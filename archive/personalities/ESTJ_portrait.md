### Portrait for an ESTJ\n\nESTJ\nAs an ESTJ, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you
deal with things rationally and logically.  Your secondary mode is
internal, where you take things in via your five senses in a literal, concrete
fashion.\nESTJs live in a world of facts and concrete needs.  They live in the present,
with their eye constantly scanning their personal environment to make sure
that everything is running smoothly and systematically.  They honor traditions
and laws, and have a clear set of standards and beliefs.
They expect the same of others, and
have no patience or understanding for individuals who do not value these
systems.  They value competence and efficiency, and like to see quick results
for their efforts.\nESTJs are take-charge people.  They have such a clear vision of the way
that things should be, that they naturally step into leadership roles.
They are self-confident, even aggressive.
They are extremely talented at devising systems and plans for action, and
at being able to see what steps need to be taken to complete a specific task.
They can sometimes be very demanding and critical, because they have such
strongly held beliefs, and are likely to express themselves without reserve
if they feel someone isn't meeting their standards.  But at least their expressions
can be taken at face-value, because the ESTJ is extremely straight-forward
and honest.\nThe ESTJ is usually a model citizen, and pillar of the community.  They take
their commitments seriously, and follows their own standards of "good citizenship"
to the letter.  ESTJs enjoy interacting with people, and like to have fun.
They can be very boisterous and fun to be around at social events, especially activities
that are focused on the family, community, or work.\nThe ESTJ needs to watch out for the tendency to be too rigid, and to become
overly detail-oriented.  Since they put a lot of weight in their own beliefs,
it's important that they remember to value other people's input and opinions.
If they neglect their Feeling side, they may have a problem with fulfilling
other's needs for intimacy, and may unknowingly hurt people's feelings by
applying logic and reason to situations which demand more emotional sensitivity.\nWhen bogged down by stress, an ESTJ often feels isolated from others.
They feel as if they are misunderstood and undervalued, and that their
efforts are
taken for granted.  Although normally the ESTJ is very verbal and doesn't
have any problem expressing themself, when under stress they have a hard
time putting their feelings into words and communicating them to others.\nESTJs value security and social order above all else, and feel obligated to
do all that they can to enhance and promote these goals.  They will mow
the lawn, vote, join the PTA, attend home owners association meetings, and
generally do anything that they can to promote personal and social security.\nThe ESTJ puts forth a lot of effort in almost everything that they do.  They
will do everything that they think should be done in their job, marriage, and
community with a good amount of energy.  They are conscientious, practical,
realistic, and dependable.  While the ESTJ will dutifully do everything that
is important to work towards a particular cause or goal, they might
not naturally see or value the importance of goals that are outside of their
practical scope.  However, if the ESTJ is able to see the relevance of such
goals to practical concerns, you can bet that they'll put every effort into
understanding them and incorporating them into their quest for clarity
and security.
