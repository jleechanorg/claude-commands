Heyward\nWhat does\nSuccess\nmean to an ENFJ?\nENFJs are motivated by external human
situations, primarily by other people; their talents, their needs, their
aspirations and their cares forming the world in which an ENFJ lives. They
thrive when able to "make things right" for others, to enable and empower their
co-workers, friends and family through valuing their human strengths and
abilities. When gifted with the added ENFJ ability to intuitively adapt their
feelings to the way they are affected by others, the ENFJ has a positive drive
to find co-operative pathways leading to the best possible outcome for all,
including themselves. Success for an ENFJ comes
through involvement in the process of making things happen for people; through the
accomplishments and satisfactions of those they have helped to enrich the human
world with greater value, and through finding that their efforts on behalf of
others have fulfilled their own life as well.\nAllowing your ENFJ strengths to flourish\nAs an ENFJ, you have gifts that are specific to your personality type
    that aren't natural strengths for other types. By recognizing your special
    gifts and encouraging their growth and development, you will more readily see
    your place in the world, and be more content with your role.\nNearly all ENFJs will recognize the following characteristics in themselves.  They should embrace and nourish these strengths\nMaking others feel valued and important\nQuickly seeing the positive and negative aspects of a human situation\nExpressing their feelings clearly\nOffering loyalty and commitment to partners, family and work mates\nTrying to always find the solution which works for everyone\nEncouraging humour and self expression in others\nFinding ways to help others fulfil their needs\nAffirming positive community values\nNaturally falling into leadership roles within their community\nENFJs who have developed their Introverted Intuition to the extent that they can see the possibilities within their perceptions will enjoy these special gifts:\nUnderstanding and empathising with the feelings of others; realizing "where they are coming from"\nA talent for creative expression which can turn ordinary things and situations into something magical\nAn enhanced feeling of connection with and sensitivity toward the world around them.\nThe ability to see many facets of a problem and the many ways it might be resolved for the best.\nThe ability to make creative and valuable use of time spent alone.\nOpenness to the spiritual connections between all things.\nThey become increasingly creative,
            visionary and empathetic, and are therefore effective and kind managers of
            businesses, people, and various situations that life presents.\nPotential problem areas\nWith any gift of strength, there is an associated weakness. Without
    "bad", there would be no "good". Without
    "difficult", there would be no "easy". We value our
    strengths, but we often curse and ignore our weaknesses. To grow as a person
    and get what we want out of life, we must not only capitalize upon our
    strengths, but also face our weaknesses and deal with them. That means taking a
    hard look at our personality type's potential problem areas.\nMost of the weaker characteristics found in ENFJs
    are due to their dominant Extraverted Feeling overvaluing what they see as
    objective values in the external world and thereby judging too much by the
    needs of others, or by appearances. This is primarily due to the ENFJ having
    not fully adapted their Introverted Intuitive function sufficiently for them to
    be able to discern the vast range of ways in which they might be being missing
    the underlying needs within themselves and being misled by such appearances.
    The ENFJ naturally looks outward to find value and satisfaction, and whilst it
    is essential that this direction be taken to fulfil their primary needs of
    relation and comfort, without the supportive balance of a well developed
    Intuitive function, ENFJs can overvalue the external
    world to the point where they lose sight of themselves, becoming fixed in their
    judgements about people and the world.
    In such cases, the ENFJ will tend to live in a rigid - and to others,
    somewhat surreal - world of definite values which often seems "overstated" or
    obsessively connected to other people or human situations.\nExplanation of problems\nNearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be
    attributed in various degrees to the common ENFJ problem of wanting to find the
    "proper" value in everything. If the ENFJ does not learn how to see beneath the
    appearance of what they quickly judge as good or bad about the people and
    situations in their external environment, they will only use their introverted
    intuition to support those judgements they feel are good for them and disregard
    not only other possibilities but their own quality of inner life as well.
    The consideration of these less obvious
    possibilities and their own needs requires that the ENFJ recognize that their
    own value judgements are indeed subjective, and that it is not appropriate or
    effective to apply them across the board to all civilized people.
    The practice of standing back and looking
    objectively at their own value system is not something that the ENFJ is
    accustomed to doing; trying to avoid abstract rationalisation of problems and
    the feelings they engender is a natural survival technique for the ENFJ
    personality.  The main driver to the ENFJ
    personality is Extraverted Feeling, whose purpose is above all to find and
    discriminate the values in people and human situations. If their ability to
    find a specific and worthy value in a person or situation is threatened, the
    ENFJ shuts out the threatening force.
    This is totally natural, but unfortunately the individual who exercises
    this type of agenda protection regularly will become more and more rigid in
    their judgements and expectations of people, but even less concerned with the
    effect such conditions have upon themselves. Where the unbalanced ENFJ does
    acquiesce to the images of intuition, these will generally be skewed to support
    the subjective agenda of dominant Feeling.
    In this way they always find justification for their determinations and
    their self sacrifices to people, things and situations, and they will be unable
    locate the reality of another's true feelings, nor be interested in discovering
    that their seemingly objective judgements miss the reasons and subjectivities
    underlying both their own and others lives or worldly situation.\nPetulance, pensiveness and a sense of being let down by others can often
    be the end result of this one-sided approach to the world, whilst if the ENFJ
    is in a strong company or relationship position they might become driven to
    manipulate others and situations to conform to their own feeling needs and
    value judgements, irrespective of any true value to the situation or for the
    other persons involved. In this case, the "big picture" valued for its great
    worth to all, becomes a dominant drive which seeks to blot out or crush any
    opposition by claiming the moral high ground, even to the point where the ENFJ
    sacrifices their own life to the "cause". The inability to recognize the
    plethora of subjective possibilities their feelings bring into their lives
    strip the unbalanced ENFJ of their access to both a deeper connection with
    others and the possibility of refining and developing pathways to the kind of
    self understanding and self nurturing their finer judgements might otherwise
    lead them to.\nSolutions\nTo grow as an individual, the ENFJ needs to focus on paying attention to
    their inner images. This means they need to be open to the possibilities that
    lie beneath their judgements and values, rather than just accepting the
    appearance of values which accord with their sense of rightness. The ENFJ needs
    to understand that developing their ability to see the subjective possibilities
    within themselves and others does not threaten their ability to make correct
    judgements, but rather enhances it, and enhances their personal chances for
    achieving a measure of success in their lives.\nThe ENFJ concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to
    their motivation for accepting values that come to them. Are they trying to see
    the background of circumstance behind their own and others value judgements, or
    are they trying to maintain their own image of how things "ought" to be? The
    goal is to find a balance between what seems correct and valuable and the many
    possible ways in which such a judgement might be subjective and not necessarily
    the best for themselves or a situation. Obviously, this is not entirely
    possible, but it is the exercise to keep in mind. They need to see the many
    divergent images of values and their conflicts which affect them, without
    feeling threatened, and without losing their sense of what is right and wrong.\nLiving happily in our world as an ENFJ\nAs can be seen from the above, some strongly expressed ENFJs
    can have difficulty fitting into society. Their
    problems are usually due to their Extraverted Feeling function being so
    dominant that they are so strongly bound to what they see as objective values
    that they cannot relate to the world except via the objects of their feeling.
    In such cases the intensity of their judgements can actually drive others away
    from them, and the resulting lack of close relationship felt as a personal
    failing for which the ENFJ feels guilty. Such guilt can drive even more
    strongly affective behaviour which leads the ENFJ to ignore their own needs
    entirely, or it can become a negative drive to manipulate others to conform to
    their one-sided vision of the world. The ENFJ who consistently tries to see the
    underlying possibilities and the scope available in each situation will be able
    to see the right path to take with each person and situation in their
    life.  This will always lead them to
    toward closer relationships, happiness and great achievements.\nThe key to personal growth for the ENFJ is competent execution of
    Introverted Intuition. Because it is often hard to define what this represents
    subjectively to each person, here are some action-oriented suggestions that
    will help lead you down the path towards more effective use of the Introverted
    Intuitive function. Specific suggestions:\nWhen confronted by a person or situation
      which seems to be rejecting or rebuffing your value judgements and your mind
      filling with all the arguments, images and alternatives to the situation, look
      closely at those you are immediately rejecting as negative or unsuitable ways
      to proceed. Within these images often lie paths to understanding and agreement
      if you look more closely. Some of these images hold the key to seeing another's
      feelings and point of view more clearly. Remember, what seems positive to you
      may not be everything or even important to another.\nBehind everything of value that you see
      lies much potential. Try not to be satisfied with just a good result, but let
      yourself imagine the ways in which a person might fulfil all their creative
      aspects; the ways in which a situation might become useful to many more than
      just what it was made for. Try to imagine everything as a source of untapped
      magic and creative power - let your mind see all the things it might become.
      Above all, apply this exercise to yourself, as if you were seeing yourself in a
      mirror: just as you would another person whom you love.\nWhen you are alone try to become fully
      aware of how it feels to you, try to recognise the emptiness as a place of
      potential, try to imagine what you might be able to do for others in this empty
      time, try to realise that you are not truly alone but with this special person
      who is yourself. What would you do for this person if you could make their
      private world a better place?\nEverything wonderful in life proceeds
      from the qualities which lie behind it. You can feel these things, these drives
      and attitudes which seem to come from a place outside, perhaps from the creator
      expressing\nhimself\nwithin people and nature. Letting
      the sense of these background qualities permeate your drive to life will give
      you purpose and meaning. Allow yourself to feel the meanings and purposes of
      the world, let them become a valuable gift which can be expressed in your
      dealings with others and in the things you strive for.
