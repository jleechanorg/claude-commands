### Portrait for an ESFJ\n\nESFJ\nAs an ESFJ, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you
deal with things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit
in with your personal value system.  Your secondary mode is internal,
where you take things in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion.\nESFJs are people persons - they love people, and are warmly interested
in others.  They use their Sensing and Judging characteristics to gather
specific, detailed information about others, and turn this information into
supportive judgments.  They want to like people, and have a special
skill at bringing out the best in others.  They are extremely good at
reading others, and understanding their point of view.  The ESFJ's strong desire
to be liked and for everything to be pleasant makes them highly supportive.
People like to be around ESFJs,
because the ESFJ has a special gift of invariably making people feel good
about themselves.\nThe ESFJ takes their responsibilities very seriously, and is very dependable.
They value security and stability, and have a strong focus on the
details of life.  They see before others do what needs to be done, and do
whatever it takes to make sure that it gets done.  They enjoy these types of
tasks, and are extremely good at them.\nESFJs are warm and energetic.
They are giving people, who get a lot of personal
satisfaction from the happiness of others. They're very sensitive to
the needs of others, and freely give practical care, asking only in return
for their generosity to be appreciated.
They want to be appreciated for their caring natures—for who they are,
and what they have to give.
They need this approval from others to feel
good about themselves, and are hurt by indifference, which they see as a form
of unkindness.\nESFJs are such caring individuals, that they sometimes have a hard time seeing
or accepting a difficult truth about someone they care about.\nWith Extraverted Feeling dominating their personality, ESFJs are focused on
reading other people and understanding the feeling-based vibes of their
community. It's extremely important to them to be seen and accepted
as someone who upholds the important human values of their community,
which sometimes translates into a need to be liked by everyone. In such cases,
an ESFJ might change their own manner to be more pleasing to whoever they're
with in the moment. If they're with someone outside of their community, with
different values, they might suspend their value judgments,
simply to fit in.\nThe ESFJ's values are formed externally, by the environment in which they
grew up and in which they live as adults. They have very
well-formed ideas about the way things should be, and are not shy about
expressing these opinions. They weigh their values and morals
against the world around them, rather than against an internal value
system, as Introverted Feelers do. The ESFJ has a strong moral code that's defined by the
community in which they live, rather than by any strongly felt internal
values. They are a super-reliable gauge of what is socially acceptable,
and don't relate to the Introverted Feeling manner of putting personal beliefs
above what's best for society at large.\nESFJs who have had the benefit of being raised and surrounded by a strong
value system that is ethical and centered around genuine goodness will
most likely be the kindest, most generous souls who will gladly give you
the shirt off of their back without a second thought.  For these individuals,
the selfless quality of their personality type is genuine and pure, and of real
value to their family, friends, and the world at large.  Those
who have not had the advantage of developing their own values by weighing
them against a good external value system may develop very questionable values.
In such cases, the ESFJ might genuinely believe in the integrity of
their skewed value system, without having any understanding of internal values
to set them straight.
In weighing their values against society, they might find
plenty of support for whatever moral transgression they wish to justify.
This type of ESFJ might be a dangerous person indeed.  Extraverted Feeling
drives them to control and manipulate, and their lack of Intuition
prevents them from seeing the big picture. They're usually quite popular
and good with people, and good at manipulating them. Unlike their ENFJ
cousin, they don't have Intuition to help them understand the real consequences
of their actions. They are driven to manipulate others to achieve their own
ends, yet they believe that they are following a solid moral code of conduct.\nAll ESFJs have a natural tendency to want to control their environment.
Their dominant function demands structure and organization, and seeks closure.
ESFJs are most comfortable with structured environments. They're not likely
to enjoy having to do things which involve abstract, theoretical concepts, or
impersonal analysis. They do enjoy creating order and structure, and are
very good at tasks which require these kinds of skills. ESFJs should mind
their tendency to try to control others when encountered with proof that
they don't want to be controlled.\nESFJs respect and believe in the laws and rules of authority, and believe
that others should do so as well.  They're traditional, and prefer to do
things in the established way, rather than venturing into unchartered territory.
Their need for security drives their ready acceptance and adherence to the
policies of the established system. This tendency may cause them to sometimes
blindly accept rules without questioning or understanding them.\nAn ESFJ who has developed in a less than ideal way may be prone to
being quite insecure, and focus all of their attention on pleasing others.
They might adopt the more negative aspects of being controlling, or be overly sensitive, imagining
bad intentions where there weren't any.\nIn some ways,
ESFJs incorporate many of the traits that are associated with women in our
society. The "ideal woman" of old would almost certainly have been an ESFJ.
However, male ESFJs will usually not appear feminine at all.
On the contrary, ESFJs are typically quite conscious about gender roles
and will be most comfortable playing a role that suits their gender in
our society.  Male ESFJs will be quite masculine (albeit sensitive
when you get to know them), and female ESFJs will
be very feminine.\nESFJs at their best are warm, sympathetic, helpful, cooperative, tactful,
down-to-earth, practical, thorough, consistent, organized, enthusiastic,
and energetic.  They enjoy tradition and security, and will seek stable
lives that are rich in contact with friends and family.
