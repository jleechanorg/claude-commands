# Analysis Directory

This directory contains all analysis results and findings from Phase 0 of the state sync enhancement project.

## Purpose

Store and organize research outputs from the narrative desynchronization analysis phase, including:

- Pattern discovery results from analyzing real game narratives
- Statistical analysis of error types and frequencies  
- Desync scenario catalogs
- Baseline metrics for current error rates
- Approach comparison studies

## Expected Contents

### Milestone 0.1: Narrative Analysis & Pattern Discovery
- `narrative_patterns.md` - Documented patterns of desynchronization found in real narratives
- Raw analysis data and statistics

### Milestone 0.4: Alternative Approach Evaluation  
- `approach_comparison.md` - Comparative analysis of different validation approaches (token-based, LLM-based, hybrid)
- Feasibility reports for each approach

## Structure

Files should be organized by milestone and include:
- Clear documentation of methodology
- Supporting data and evidence
- Actionable insights and recommendations
- Links to source data in the `data/` directory
