**Q3: Are users currently experiencing errors when trying to use planning blocks in V2?**
Answer: **YES** (they are not there - missing entirely)

## Summary
- Planning blocks are completely missing from V2 (not just broken)
- Need to maintain V2's visual design language while implementing the feature
- Feature should integrate with V2's real-time update system
- No other V2 features should be modified
