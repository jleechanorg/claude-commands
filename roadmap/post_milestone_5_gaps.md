# Post-Milestone 5: Remaining Gaps from Figma Design

## Overview
After Milestone 5 completes (landing page, OKLCH colors, glassmorphism, basic polish), significant gaps will remain between the MVP and the full Figma vision.

## Major Features Still Missing

### 1. 🎮 Game View Enhancements (Critical)
The Figma GameView is dramatically more sophisticated than current MVP:

**Character Management**
- Full character sheet sidebar (HP, AC, Stats, Level, Class)
- Visual progress bars for health/resources
- Equipment and inventory display
- Character portrait integration

**Interactive Elements**
- Quick action buttons (Attack, Cast Spell, Skill Check)
- Dice roll interface with visual feedback
- Context-aware action suggestions
- Character/God mode toggle

**Story Presentation**
- Different styling for narration/dialogue/action/system messages
- "Game Master is thinking..." loading animations
- Better message grouping and formatting
- Export/download campaign feature

### 2. 🧩 Advanced UI Components
Figma includes a full component library we haven't touched:

**Data Management**
- Data tables for campaigns/characters
- Pagination for large lists
- Advanced sorting/filtering
- Bulk actions support

**Navigation & Discovery**
- Command palette (Cmd+K style)
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Collapsible sidebar sections
- Interactive tooltips/tours

**Form Components**
- Multi-select dropdowns
- Date/time pickers
- File upload areas
- OTP/verification inputs

### 3. 🔄 Complex Interactions
**Not Yet Implemented**
- Drag & drop for inventory/organization
- Keyboard shortcuts system
- Right-click context menus
- Resizable panels/layouts
- Real-time collaboration features
- Undo/redo functionality

### 4. 📊 Data Visualization & Analytics
**Campaign Insights**
- Play frequency charts
- Story length statistics
- Character progression graphs
- Session history timeline
- Decision tree visualization

### 5. 🎯 User Experience Enhancements
**Polish Features**
- Empty state illustrations
- Error boundary designs
- Skeleton screens for all views
- Progressive disclosure patterns
- Offline mode indicators
- Connection status display

## Backend-Dependent Features

These Figma features require significant backend work:

1. **AI Persona System** - Jeff's three personalities (Narrative/Mechanical/Calibration)
2. **World Building Tools** - Custom world creation and lore management
3. **Companion System** - AI-controlled party members
4. **Session Management** - Save points, branching narratives
5. **Campaign Templates** - Shareable starting scenarios
6. **Real-time Sync** - Multi-player simultaneous play

## Recommended Next Milestones

### Milestone 6: Game Experience Enhancement (8-10 hours)
**Priority: CRITICAL** - This is where users spend most time
- Full GameView implementation from Figma
- Character sheet sidebar
- Quick actions system
- Story formatting improvements
- Export functionality

### Milestone 7: Advanced Components (6-8 hours)
**Priority: HIGH** - Power user features
- Data tables implementation
- Command palette
- Advanced search/filter
- Notification system (toasts)
- Keyboard shortcuts

### Milestone 8: Polish & Delight (4-6 hours)
**Priority: MEDIUM** - Professional touches
- Empty states design
- Error boundaries
- Loading skeletons
- Animations library
- Micro-interactions

### Milestone 9: Collaboration Features (10-12 hours)
**Priority: FUTURE** - Requires backend
- Real-time multiplayer
- Campaign sharing
- User profiles
- Social features

## Summary

The Figma design represents a **complete professional TTRPG platform**, while our MVP + M5 provides a **functional foundation with visual polish**. The primary gaps are:

1. **Game Experience** - Where users actually play is still basic
2. **Power User Features** - Advanced navigation and data management
3. **Social/Collaborative** - Multi-player and sharing capabilities
4. **Data Intelligence** - Analytics and insights

The highest priority post-M5 should be **enhancing the actual game playing experience** (Milestone 6), as this is where users spend 90% of their time.
