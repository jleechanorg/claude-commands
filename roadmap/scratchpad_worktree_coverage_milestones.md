# Execute Command Milestones - worktree_coverage

**Task**: Modify scratchpad protocol implementation with timeout handling insights and solid strategy
**Start Time**: 2025-01-09 (timestamp noted)
**Method**: Direct execution (single file focus)

## Summary

### Final Milestone: Task Complete - [00:12:00]
**Status**: ✅ Complete

#### Overall Accomplishments:
- Successfully modified protocol implementation with comprehensive strategy
- Added API timeout prevention to both CLAUDE.md and scratchpad
- Created structured approach with hierarchy, checklists, and anti-patterns
- Total changes: 3 files, 450+ lines added

#### PR Created:
- PR #460: https://github.com/jleechan2015/worldarchitect.ai/pull/460
- Title: "feat: Protocol implementation strategy - Milestones 1-2"
- Includes all milestone work from this execution

#### Key Innovations:
1. **CLAUDE_CORE.md concept** - 10 essential rules to reduce cognitive load
2. **Memory aids** - VESTS and BEFORE acronyms
3. **Anti-patterns gallery** - Real examples of violations
4. **Forcing functions** - 4 levels of protocol enforcement
5. **Workflow checklists** - Actionable steps for common tasks

#### Lessons Learned:
- API timeouts can be prevented by avoiding /think for simple tasks
- MultiEdit is effective for large document modifications
- Concrete examples (anti-patterns) are more effective than abstract rules
- Visual hierarchy with emojis improves rule scanning

#### Time Tracking:
- Total time: 12 minutes
- Milestone 1: 5 minutes (core modifications)
- Milestone 2: 5 minutes (advanced strategies)
- PR creation: 2 minutes
