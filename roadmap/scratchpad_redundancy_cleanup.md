# CLAUDE.md Redundancy Cleanup Scratchpad

**Created**: July 8, 2025  
**Branch**: dev1752038123
**Purpose**: Track redundancy removal and integration in CLAUDE.md

## Changes Made

### 1. Integrated Key Lines into Document Analysis Protocol

Added to Document Analysis Protocol:
- ✅ Base all debugging claims on actual behavior, not theory
- ❌ NEVER analyze what you haven't seen  
- ❌ NEVER suggest fixes without understanding the actual error

**Reason**: These were scattered in Evidence-Based Development but belong in the comprehensive debugging protocol.

### 2. Removed Redundant "Extract Evidence" References

**Removed from**:
- Anti-Hallucination Measures (kept other parts)
- Evidence-Based Development section (removed entirely)

**Kept in**: Document Analysis Protocol (most comprehensive location)

### 3. Kept Communication Standards

Initially thought redundant, but "Professional and analytical" and "Technical precision" aren't explicitly stated elsewhere.

## Summary of Deletions

1. **From Anti-Hallucination Measures**:
   - Removed: "ALWAYS extract direct quotes/code/errors before analysis"
   - Kept: Everything else about not fabricating

2. **Entire Evidence-Based Development Section**:
   - All points were redundant with Document Analysis Protocol
   - Key phrases integrated into Document Analysis Protocol

## Net Result

- Reduced redundancy while preserving all important concepts
- Document Analysis Protocol is now the single source of truth for evidence extraction
- Clearer, more concise CLAUDE.md without losing any rules
