- Test Status: ✅ PASS (clean audit, no fixes needed)
- Iterations Required: 1 (early completion)

## Final Summary
- Total Iterations: 1 (stopped early - clean audit)
- Issues Fixed: 0/0 (100% - no issues found)
- Code Quality: ✅ EXCELLENT (all real implementations)
- Learnings Captured: No fake patterns found to capture

## Branch Modified Files Analysis
Files to analyze for fake patterns:
- genesis/genesis.py (modified)
- genesis/docs/sample-project-specs.md (modified)
- docs/benchmark-genesis-vs-ralph-2025-09-28.md (new)
- text_processor/ (new directory with all files)
- CLAUDE.md (modified)

## Iteration 1

**Detection Results:**
- Critical Issues: 0
- Suspicious Patterns: 0
- Files Analyzed: 17
- ✅ CLEAN AUDIT: No fake code patterns detected!

**Analysis Summary:**
All branch-modified files show genuine implementations:
- text_processor/: Complete working CLI with real operations
- genesis/genesis.py: Actual codex integration improvements
- docs/: Legitimate benchmark documentation
- All tests: Real functionality testing, not mock simulations

**Evidence of Real Code:**
- text_processor operations perform actual text processing
- No placeholder comments or TODO stubs
- All imports resolve to real modules
- Tests validate genuine functionality
- Genesis enhancements implement actual codex execution
- Type annotations correctly reflect actual behavior
