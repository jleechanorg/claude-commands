After the listing attempt, an explicit determination was made to halt further Genesis TDD workflow activity because the driving specification\u2014referred to repeatedly as \u201cGOAL: [specific technical description]\u201d\u2014remained undefined, rendering every downstream testing and implementation requirement impossible to execute without violating the \u201cNO PLACEHOLDERS\u201d rule.\n\nESSENTIAL FINDINGS:\nAll Genesis governance layers consistently reference a concrete technical goal that was never supplied, so the system lacks the behavioral contract required to synthesize either the comprehensive test suite or the production-ready implementation demanded by the TDD mandate. The prior execution sequence culminated in the hard failure `EXECUTION_FAILED: specific technical description for the goal is missing, cannot proceed`, demonstrating that, despite full danger-mode filesystem access and unrestricted tooling, the absence of a precise problem statement is the singular blocking issue. No unit, integration, edge-case, performance, or security tests exist yet; no code changes were produced; and no partial scaffolding was created, because generating any artifact without the missing specification would breach Genesis\u2019s exacting expectations for determinism, coverage, and readiness.\n\nNEXT FOCUS:\nProvide the missing detailed technical goal description so the next iteration can synthesize exhaustive tests first, then the corresponding implementation, while staying within the one-task-per-loop discipline and the comprehensive Genesis TDD contract.\n\nCONTEXT:\nOperations occurred under OpenAI Codex v0.42.0 (research preview) with high reasoning effort, automatic reasoning summaries, danger-full-access sandboxing, never-requested approvals, and network access enabled, yet the workflow is still stalled pending the essential goal definition. The scheduler\u2019s governance, the Genesis TDD Generation charter, and the enforcement of full implementations with zero placeholders remain active constraints awaiting re-entry once the blocking specification is supplied. Content is insufficient to reach the 2000-token target because no additional execution artifacts, decisions, or discoveries exist beyond the constraint reiterations and the recorded failure state.\n[2025-09-30T08:36:18] tokens used: 5,392\n\nExecution Results:\nReading prompt from stdin...\n[2025-09-30T08:36:25] OpenAI Codex v0.42.0 (research preview)\n--------\nworkdir: /Users/jleechan/projects/worktree_ralph\nmodel: gpt-5-codex\nprovider: openai\napproval: never\nsandbox: danger-full-access\nreasoning effort: high\nreasoning summaries: auto\n--------\n[2025-09-30T08:36:25] User instructions:\nGENESIS EXECUTION - SEARCH-FIRST DIRECT IMPLEMENTATION\n\nCORE CODEX PRINCIPLES:\n- ONE ITEM PER LOOP: Execute exactly one task (enforced)\n- DIRECT IMPLEMENTATION: Write code directly, no delegation\n- SEARCH FIRST: Validate before building (see validation below)\n- NO PLACEHOLDERS: Full implementations only\n- CONTEXT ENHANCEMENT: Detailed context within 2000 tokens\n\nGOAL: [specific technical description]\nITERATION: 1\nPLAN CONTEXT: \n\nSEARCH VALIDATION RESULT:\nReading prompt from stdin...\n[2025-09-30T08:36:18] OpenAI Codex v0.42.0 (research preview)\n--------\nworkdir: /Users/jleechan/projects/worktree_ralph\nmodel: gpt-5-codex\nprovider: openai\napproval: never\nsandbox: danger-full-access\nreasoning effort: high\nreasoning summaries: auto\n--------\n[2025-09-30T08:36:18] User instructions:\nGENESIS SEARCH-FIRST VALIDATION\n\nTASK TO VALIDATE: EXECUTION FOCUS: Test, Fix, and Adapt Generated Code\n\nGENERATED TDD CONTENT:\nReading prompt from stdin...\n[2025-09-30T08:35:13] OpenAI Codex v0.42.0 (research preview)\n--------\nworkdir: /Users/jleechan/projects/worktree_ralph\nmodel: gpt-5-codex\nprovider: openai\napproval: never\nsandbox: danger-full-access\nreasoning effort: high\nreasoning summaries: auto\n--------\n[2025-09-30T08:35:13] User instructions:\nGENESIS TDD GENERATION - COMPREHENSIVE TESTS AND IMPLEMENTATION\n\nCORE GENESIS PRINCIPLES:\n- COMPREHENSIVE TESTING: Generate complete test suite covering all edge cases\n- FULL IMPLEMENTATION: Provide complete, working implementation (no placeholders)\n- TDD METHODOLOGY: Tests drive implementation design and validation\n- PRODUCTION READY: Code should be deployable and maintainable\n\nGOAL: [specific technical description]\nITERATION: 1\nPLAN CONTEXT: \n\nEXECUTION STRATEGY:\nReading prompt from stdin...\n[2025-09-30T08:34:24] OpenAI Codex v0.42.0 (research preview)\n--------\nworkdir: /Users/jleechan/projects/worktree_ralph\nmodel: gpt-5-codex\nprovider: openai\napproval: never\ns...\n\nEXECUTION TASKS:\n1.

bench_cmd (synced +uncommitted) | Remote: origin/bench_cmd | PR: #1792 https://github.com/jleechanorg/worldarchitect.ai/pull/1792]\nKEY DECISIONS:\n- Committed to a single actionable step\u2014capturing the repository\u2019s top-level directory listing from `/Users/jleechan/projects/worktree_ralph`\u2014in strict compliance with the enforced \u201cone item per loop\u201d Genesis scheduler directive, ensuring foundational situational awareness without violating governance rules.\n- Chose to halt all TDD generation attempts immediately after detecting that the mission-critical \u201cGOAL: [specific technical description]\u201d parameter remained unspecified, recognizing that proceeding without it would breach the \u201cNO PLACEHOLDERS\u201d and \u201cFULL IMPLEMENTATION ONLY\u201d constraints.\n- Escalated the missing-goal condition as the primary blocker by emitting the explicit failure `EXECUTION_FAILED: specific technical description for the goal is missing, cannot proceed`, effectively preventing misguided code or test synthesis.\n- Resolved to preserve the pristine state of the codebase by refraining from generating speculative artifacts, thereby maintaining alignment with Genesis\u2019s demand for deterministic, production-ready deliverables.\n\nESSENTIAL FINDINGS:\n- The repository inventory revealed numerous configuration and tooling assets\u2014`.env.example`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `.eslintrc.js`, `.firebaserc`, `.pr-metadata.json`, `.playwright-mcp`, `.mypy_cache`, `.pytest_cache`, `.infra-structure.conf.example`, and hidden directories such as `.cursor`, `.claude`, `.qwen`\u2014indicating a sophisticated, multi-language environment prepared for rigorous automation, linting, and testing workflows.\n- Despite extensive governance prompts reiterating Genesis principles (comprehensive testing, TDD-first implementation, no placeholders, production readiness, contextual thoroughness), none supplied the concrete behavioral contract; the placeholder `[specific technical description]` persisted unchanged across the Primary Scheduler, TDD Generation, Search-First Validation, and Execution directives.\n- Validation infrastructure confirmed that the absence of the goal specification is the singular gating issue; no prior test suites, implementations, or even partial scaffolds exist for the targeted functionality, so there are zero legacy artifacts to adapt or extend.\n- Network-enabled, danger-full-access operational mode did not mitigate the blocker; even with unrestricted filesystem reach and the ability to run arbitrary commands, the process cannot invent requirements, underscoring that Genesis compliance hinges on precise user intent.\n- The enforced response format demanded structured status reporting (KEY DECISIONS, ESSENTIAL FINDINGS, NEXT FOCUS, CONTEXT) and repeat confirmations that no progress beyond environment inspection occurred, leaving a transparent audit trail.\n- Repeated attempts to initiate the Search-First Validation pipeline encountered `unexpected status 404 Not Found: {\"detail\":\"Not Found\"}` errors, implying that the upstream validation endpoint or artifact repository lacks entries corresponding to the missing goal, further reinforcing the gap.\n\nNEXT FOCUS:\n- Obtain and confirm the exact technical goal definition so a subsequent loop can author the exhaustive TDD suite, drive the implementation, and validate end-to-end behavior without contravening Genesis constraints.\n\nCONTEXT:\n- Operating parameters: OpenAI Codex v0.42.0 (research preview); high reasoning effort with automatic reasoning summaries; sandbox mode `danger-full-access`; approval policy `never`; network access enabled; working directory `/Users/jleechan/projects/worktree_ralph`.\n- Repository state: local branch `bench_cmd` (synced with uncommitted changes), remote `origin/bench_cmd`, associated PR #1792; no modifications introduced during this iteration (`NO_CHANGES`).\n- Activity record: executed `ls -a` once to catalog the repository; no additional commands issued; no tests run; no files edited; no diff generated; implementation status remains at 0% pending specification.\n- Content inventory remains insufficient to reach the 2000-token expansion target because the workflow is stalled at the requirement-gathering phase; additional technical detail awaits the missing goal description.\n[2025-09-30T08:37:24] tokens used: 13,421\nReading prompt from stdin...\n[2025-09-30T08:37:24] OpenAI

After the listing attempt, an explicit determination was made to halt further Genesis TDD workflow activity because the driving specification\u2014referred to repeatedly as \u201cGOAL: [specific technical description]\u201d\u2014remained undefined, rendering every downstream testing and implementation requirement impossible to execute without violating the \u201cNO PLACEHOLDERS\u201d rule.\n\nESSENTIAL FINDINGS:\nAll Genesis governance layers consistently reference a concrete technical goal that was never supplied, so the system lacks the behavioral contract required to synthesize either the comprehensive test suite or the production-ready implementation demanded by the TDD mandate. The prior execution sequence culminated in the hard failure `EXECUTION_FAILED: specific technical description for the goal is missing, cannot proceed`, demonstrating that, despite full danger-mode filesystem access and unrestricted tooling, the absence of a precise problem statement is the singular blocking issue. No unit, integration, edge-case, performance, or security tests exist yet; no code changes were produced; and no partial scaffolding was created, because generating any artifact without the missing specification would breach Genesis\u2019s exacting expectations for determinism, coverage, and readiness.\n\nNEXT FOCUS:\nProvide the missing detailed technical goal description so the next iteration can synthesize exhaustive tests first, then the corresponding implementation, while staying within the one-task-per-loop discipline and the comprehensive Genesis TDD contract.\n\nCONTEXT:\nOperations occurred under OpenAI Codex v0.42.0 (research preview) with high reasoning effort, automatic reasoning summaries, danger-full-access sandboxing, never-requested approvals, and network access enabled, yet the workflow is still stalled pending the essential goal definition. The scheduler\u2019s governance, the Genesis TDD Generation charter, and the enforcement of full implementations with zero placeholders remain active constraints awaiting re-entry once the blocking specification is supplied. Content is insufficient to reach the 2000-token target because no additional execution artifacts, decisions, or discoveries exist beyond the constraint reiterations and the recorded failure state.\n[2025-09-30T08:36:18] tokens used: 5,392\n\nExecution Results:\nReading prompt from stdin...\n[2025-09-30T08:36:25] OpenAI Codex v0.42.0 (research preview)\n--------\nworkdir: /Users/jleechan/projects/worktree_ralph\nmodel: gpt-5-codex\nprovider: openai\napproval: never\nsandbox: danger-full-access\nreasoning effort: high\nreasoning summaries: auto\n--------\n[2025-09-30T08:36:25] User instructions:\nGENESIS EXECUTION - SEARCH-FIRST DIRECT IMPLEMENTATION\n\nCORE CODEX PRINCIPLES:\n- ONE ITEM PER LOOP: Execute exactly one task (enforced)\n- DIRECT IMPLEMENTATION: Write code directly, no delegation\n- SEARCH FIRST: Validate before building (see validation below)\n- NO PLACEHOLDERS: Full implementations only\n- CONTEXT ENHANCEMENT: Detailed context within 2000 tokens\n\nGOAL: [specific technical description]\nITERATION: 1\nPLAN CONTEXT: \n\nSEARCH VALIDATION RESULT:\nReading prompt from stdin...\n[2025-09-30T08:36:18] OpenAI Codex v0.42.0 (research preview)\n--------\nworkdir: /Users/jleechan/projects/worktree_ralph\nmodel: gpt-5-codex\nprovider: openai\napproval: never\nsandbox: danger-full-access\nreasoning effort: high\nreasoning summaries: auto\n--------\n[2025-09-30T08:36:18] User instructions:\nGENESIS SEARCH-FIRST VALIDATION\n\nTASK TO VALIDATE: EXECUTION FOCUS: Test, Fix, and Adapt Generated Code\n\nGENERATED TDD CONTENT:\nReading prompt from stdin...\n[2025-09-30T08:35:13] OpenAI Codex v0.42.0 (research preview)\n--------\nworkdir: /Users/jleechan/projects/worktree_ralph\nmodel: gpt-5-codex\nprovider: openai\napproval: never\nsandbox: danger-full-access\nreasoning effort: high\nreasoning summaries: auto\n--------\n[2025-09-30T08:35:13] User instructions:\nGENESIS TDD GENERATION - COMPREHENSIVE TESTS AND IMPLEMENTATION\n\nCORE GENESIS PRINCIPLES:\n- COMPREHENSIVE TESTING: Generate complete test suite covering all edge cases\n- FULL IMPLEMENTATION: Provide complete, working implementation (no placeholders)\n- TDD METHODOLOGY: Tests drive implementation design and validation\n- PRODUCTION READY: Code should be deployable and maintainable\n\nGOAL: [specific technical description]\nITERATION: 1\nPLAN CONTEXT: \n\nEXECUTION STRATEGY:\nReading prompt from stdin...\n[2025-09-30T08:34:24] OpenAI Codex v0.42.0 (research preview)\n--------\nworkdir: /Users/jleechan/projects/worktree_ralph\nmodel: gpt-5-codex\nprovider: openai\napproval: never\ns...\n\nEXECUTION TASKS:\n1.

After the listing attempt, an explicit determination was made to halt further Genesis TDD workflow activity because the driving specification\u2014referred to repeatedly as \u201cGOAL: [specific technical description]\u201d\u2014remained undefined, rendering every downstream testing and implementation requirement impossible to execute without violating the \u201cNO PLACEHOLDERS\u201d rule.\n\nESSENTIAL FINDINGS:\nAll Genesis governance layers consistently reference a concrete technical goal that was never supplied, so the system lacks the behavioral contract required to synthesize either the comprehensive test suite or the production-ready implementation demanded by the TDD mandate. The prior execution sequence culminated in the hard failure `EXECUTION_FAILED: specific technical description for the goal is missing, cannot proceed`, demonstrating that, despite full danger-mode filesystem access and unrestricted tooling, the absence of a precise problem statement is the singular blocking issue. No unit, integration, edge-case, performance, or security tests exist yet; no code changes were produced; and no partial scaffolding was created, because generating any artifact without the missing specification would breach Genesis\u2019s exacting expectations for determinism, coverage, and readiness.\n\nNEXT FOCUS:\nProvide the missing detailed technical goal description so the next iteration can synthesize exhaustive tests first, then the corresponding implementation, while staying within the one-task-per-loop discipline and the comprehensive Genesis TDD contract.\n\nCONTEXT:\nOperations occurred under OpenAI Codex v0.42.0 (research preview) with high reasoning effort, automatic reasoning summaries, danger-full-access sandboxing, never-requested approvals, and network access enabled, yet the workflow is still stalled pending the essential goal definition. The scheduler\u2019s governance, the Genesis TDD Generation charter, and the enforcement of full implementations with zero placeholders remain active constraints awaiting re-entry once the blocking specification is supplied. Content is insufficient to reach the 2000-token target because no additional execution artifacts, decisions, or discoveries exist beyond the constraint reiterations and the recorded failure state.\n[2025-09-30T08:36:18] tokens used: 5,392\n\nExecution Results:\nReading prompt from stdin...\n[2025-09-30T08:36:25] OpenAI Codex v0.42.0 (research preview)\n--------\nworkdir: /Users/jleechan/projects/worktree_ralph\nmodel: gpt-5-codex\nprovider: openai\napproval: never\nsandbox: danger-full-access\nreasoning effort: high\nreasoning summaries: auto\n--------\n[2025-09-30T08:36:25] User instructions:\nGENESIS EXECUTION - SEARCH-FIRST DIRECT IMPLEMENTATION\n\nCORE CODEX PRINCIPLES:\n- ONE ITEM PER LOOP: Execute exactly one task (enforced)\n- DIRECT IMPLEMENTATION: Write code directly, no delegation\n- SEARCH FIRST: Validate before building (see validation below)\n- NO PLACEHOLDERS: Full implementations only\n- CONTEXT ENHANCEMENT: Detailed context within 2000 tokens\n\nGOAL: [specific technical description]\nITERATION: 1\nPLAN CONTEXT: \n\nSEARCH VALIDATION RESULT:\nReading prompt from stdin...\n[2025-09-30T08:36:18] OpenAI Codex v0.42.0 (research preview)\n--------\nworkdir: /Users/jleechan/projects/worktree_ralph\nmodel: gpt-5-codex\nprovider: openai\napproval: never\nsandbox: danger-full-access\nreasoning effort: high\nreasoning summaries: auto\n--------\n[2025-09-30T08:36:18] User instructions:\nGENESIS SEARCH-FIRST VALIDATION\n\nTASK TO VALIDATE: EXECUTION FOCUS: Test, Fix, and Adapt Generated Code\n\nGENERATED TDD CONTENT:\nReading prompt from stdin...\n[2025-09-30T08:35:13] OpenAI Codex v0.42.0 (research preview)\n--------\nworkdir: /Users/jleechan/projects/worktree_ralph\nmodel: gpt-5-codex\nprovider: openai\napproval: never\nsandbox: danger-full-access\nreasoning effort: high\nreasoning summaries: auto\n--------\n[2025-09-30T08:35:13] User instructions:\nGENESIS TDD GENERATION - COMPREHENSIVE TESTS AND IMPLEMENTATION\n\nCORE GENESIS PRINCIPLES:\n- COMPREHENSIVE TESTING: Generate complete test suite covering all edge cases\n- FULL IMPLEMENTATION: Provide complete, working implementation (no placeholders)\n- TDD METHODOLOGY: Tests drive implementation design and validation\n- PRODUCTION READY: Code should be deployable and maintainable\n\nGOAL: [specific technical description]\nITERATION: 1\nPLAN CONTEXT: \n\nEXECUTION STRATEGY:\nReading prompt from stdin...\n[2025-09-30T08:34:24] OpenAI Codex v0.42.0 (research preview)\n--------\nworkdir: /Users/jleechan/projects/worktree_ralph\nmodel: gpt-5-codex\nprovider: openai\napproval: never\ns...\n\nEXECUTION TASKS:\n1.

bench_cmd (synced +uncommitted) | Remote: origin/bench_cmd | PR: #1792 https://github.com/jleechanorg/worldarchitect.ai/pull/1792]\nKEY DECISIONS:\n- Committed to a single actionable step\u2014capturing the repository\u2019s top-level directory listing from `/Users/jleechan/projects/worktree_ralph`\u2014in strict compliance with the enforced \u201cone item per loop\u201d Genesis scheduler directive, ensuring foundational situational awareness without violating governance rules.\n- Chose to halt all TDD generation attempts immediately after detecting that the mission-critical \u201cGOAL: [specific technical description]\u201d parameter remained unspecified, recognizing that proceeding without it would breach the \u201cNO PLACEHOLDERS\u201d and \u201cFULL IMPLEMENTATION ONLY\u201d constraints.\n- Escalated the missing-goal condition as the primary blocker by emitting the explicit failure `EXECUTION_FAILED: specific technical description for the goal is missing, cannot proceed`, effectively preventing misguided code or test synthesis.\n- Resolved to preserve the pristine state of the codebase by refraining from generating speculative artifacts, thereby maintaining alignment with Genesis\u2019s demand for deterministic, production-ready deliverables.\n\nESSENTIAL FINDINGS:\n- The repository inventory revealed numerous configuration and tooling assets\u2014`.env.example`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `.eslintrc.js`, `.firebaserc`, `.pr-metadata.json`, `.playwright-mcp`, `.mypy_cache`, `.pytest_cache`, `.infra-structure.conf.example`, and hidden directories such as `.cursor`, `.claude`, `.qwen`\u2014indicating a sophisticated, multi-language environment prepared for rigorous automation, linting, and testing workflows.\n- Despite extensive governance prompts reiterating Genesis principles (comprehensive testing, TDD-first implementation, no placeholders, production readiness, contextual thoroughness), none supplied the concrete behavioral contract; the placeholder `[specific technical description]` persisted unchanged across the Primary Scheduler, TDD Generation, Search-First Validation, and Execution directives.\n- Validation infrastructure confirmed that the absence of the goal specification is the singular gating issue; no prior test suites, implementations, or even partial scaffolds exist for the targeted functionality, so there are zero legacy artifacts to adapt or extend.\n- Network-enabled, danger-full-access operational mode did not mitigate the blocker; even with unrestricted filesystem reach and the ability to run arbitrary commands, the process cannot invent requirements, underscoring that Genesis compliance hinges on precise user intent.\n- The enforced response format demanded structured status reporting (KEY DECISIONS, ESSENTIAL FINDINGS, NEXT FOCUS, CONTEXT) and repeat confirmations that no progress beyond environment inspection occurred, leaving a transparent audit trail.\n- Repeated attempts to initiate the Search-First Validation pipeline encountered `unexpected status 404 Not Found: {\"detail\":\"Not Found\"}` errors, implying that the upstream validation endpoint or artifact repository lacks entries corresponding to the missing goal, further reinforcing the gap.\n\nNEXT FOCUS:\n- Obtain and confirm the exact technical goal definition so a subsequent loop can author the exhaustive TDD suite, drive the implementation, and validate end-to-end behavior without contravening Genesis constraints.\n\nCONTEXT:\n- Operating parameters: OpenAI Codex v0.42.0 (research preview); high reasoning effort with automatic reasoning summaries; sandbox mode `danger-full-access`; approval policy `never`; network access enabled; working directory `/Users/jleechan/projects/worktree_ralph`.\n- Repository state: local branch `bench_cmd` (synced with uncommitted changes), remote `origin/bench_cmd`, associated PR #1792; no modifications introduced during this iteration (`NO_CHANGES`).\n- Activity record: executed `ls -a` once to catalog the repository; no additional commands issued; no tests run; no files edited; no diff generated; implementation status remains at 0% pending specification.\n- Content inventory remains insufficient to reach the 2000-token expansion target because the workflow is stalled at the requirement-gathering phase; additional technical detail awaits the missing goal description.\n[2025-09-30T08:37:24] tokens used: 13,421\nReading prompt from stdin...\n[2025-09-30T08:37:24] OpenAI

After the listing attempt, an explicit determination was made to halt further Genesis TDD workflow activity because the driving specification\u2014referred to repeatedly as \u201cGOAL: [specific technical description]\u201d\u2014remained undefined, rendering every downstream testing and implementation requirement impossible to execute without violating the \u201cNO PLACEHOLDERS\u201d rule.\n\nESSENTIAL FINDINGS:\nAll Genesis governance layers consistently reference a concrete technical goal that was never supplied, so the system lacks the behavioral contract required to synthesize either the comprehensive test suite or the production-ready implementation demanded by the TDD mandate. The prior execution sequence culminated in the hard failure `EXECUTION_FAILED: specific technical description for the goal is missing, cannot proceed`, demonstrating that, despite full danger-mode filesystem access and unrestricted tooling, the absence of a precise problem statement is the singular blocking issue. No unit, integration, edge-case, performance, or security tests exist yet; no code changes were produced; and no partial scaffolding was created, because generating any artifact without the missing specification would breach Genesis\u2019s exacting expectations for determinism, coverage, and readiness.\n\nNEXT FOCUS:\nProvide the missing detailed technical goal description so the next iteration can synthesize exhaustive tests first, then the corresponding implementation, while staying within the one-task-per-loop discipline and the comprehensive Genesis TDD contract.\n\nCONTEXT:\nOperations occurred under OpenAI Codex v0.42.0 (research preview) with high reasoning effort, automatic reasoning summaries, danger-full-access sandboxing, never-requested approvals, and network access enabled, yet the workflow is still stalled pending the essential goal definition. The scheduler\u2019s governance, the Genesis TDD Generation charter, and the enforcement of full implementations with zero placeholders remain active constraints awaiting re-entry once the blocking specification is supplied. Content is insufficient to reach the 2000-token target because no additional execution artifacts, decisions, or discoveries exist beyond the constraint reiterations and the recorded failure state.\n[2025-09-30T08:36:18] tokens used: 5,392\n\nExecution Results:\nReading prompt from stdin...\n[2025-09-30T08:36:25] OpenAI Codex v0.42.0 (research preview)\n--------\nworkdir: /Users/jleechan/projects/worktree_ralph\nmodel: gpt-5-codex\nprovider: openai\napproval: never\nsandbox: danger-full-access\nreasoning effort: high\nreasoning summaries: auto\n--------\n[2025-09-30T08:36:25] User instructions:\nGENESIS EXECUTION - SEARCH-FIRST DIRECT IMPLEMENTATION\n\nCORE CODEX PRINCIPLES:\n- ONE ITEM PER LOOP: Execute exactly one task (enforced)\n- DIRECT IMPLEMENTATION: Write code directly, no delegation\n- SEARCH FIRST: Validate before building (see validation below)\n- NO PLACEHOLDERS: Full implementations only\n- CONTEXT ENHANCEMENT: Detailed context within 2000 tokens\n\nGOAL: [specific technical description]\nITERATION: 1\nPLAN CONTEXT: \n\nSEARCH VALIDATION RESULT:\nReading prompt from stdin...\n[2025-09-30T08:36:18] OpenAI Codex v0.42.0 (research preview)\n--------\nworkdir: /Users/jleechan/projects/worktree_ralph\nmodel: gpt-5-codex\nprovider: openai\napproval: never\nsandbox: danger-full-access\nreasoning effort: high\nreasoning summaries: auto\n--------\n[2025-09-30T08:36:18] User instructions:\nGENESIS SEARCH-FIRST VALIDATION\n\nTASK TO VALIDATE: EXECUTION FOCUS: Test, Fix, and Adapt Generated Code\n\nGENERATED TDD CONTENT:\nReading prompt from stdin...\n[2025-09-30T08:35:13] OpenAI Codex v0.42.0 (research preview)\n--------\nworkdir: /Users/jleechan/projects/worktree_ralph\nmodel: gpt-5-codex\nprovider: openai\napproval: never\nsandbox: danger-full-access\nreasoning effort: high\nreasoning summaries: auto\n--------\n[2025-09-30T08:35:13] User instructions:\nGENESIS TDD GENERATION - COMPREHENSIVE TESTS AND IMPLEMENTATION\n\nCORE GENESIS PRINCIPLES:\n- COMPREHENSIVE TESTING: Generate complete test suite covering all edge cases\n- FULL IMPLEMENTATION: Provide complete, working implementation (no placeholders)\n- TDD METHODOLOGY: Tests drive implementation design and validation\n- PRODUCTION READY: Code should be deployable and maintainable\n\nGOAL: [specific technical description]\nITERATION: 1\nPLAN CONTEXT: \n\nEXECUTION STRATEGY:\nReading prompt from stdin...\n[2025-09-30T08:34:24] OpenAI Codex v0.42.0 (research preview)\n--------\nworkdir: /Users/jleechan/projects/worktree_ralph\nmodel: gpt-5-codex\nprovider: openai\napproval: never\ns...\n\nEXECUTION TASKS:\n1.

PROVIDE direct implementation approach\n4. DEMAND full implementation (no TODOs)\n5. BREAK DOWN large goals into incremental progress\n\nEXECUTION STRATEGY FORMAT:\nSINGLE FOCUS: [ONE specific task only - if goal is large, pick first logical component]\nEXECUTION PLAN: [direct implementation approach]\nSUCCESS CRITERIA: [clear completion criteria]\nNO PLACEHOLDERS: [enforcement approach]\nINCREMENTAL PROGRESS: [how this task contributes to larger goal]\n\nGENESIS VALIDATION: Strategy will be rejected if multiple tasks detected.\nAUTONOMOUS GUIDANCE: For large goals, start with foundation/setup tasks first.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS: Keep response to 2-3 sentences maximum. Be direct and specific about what code to write or task to complete.\n\n\nSTRICT ENFORCEMENT: Previous strategy rejected for multi-tasking.\nMUST focus on EXACTLY ONE TASK. No exceptions.\n\n\n[2025-09-30T08:34:40] thinking\n\n**Formulating focused execution strategy**\n[2025-09-30T08:34:40] codex\n\n[Dir: worktree_ralph | Local: bench_cmd (synced +uncommitted) | Remote: origin/bench_cmd | PR: #1792 https://github.com/jleechanorg/worldarchitect.ai/pull/1792] SINGLE FOCUS: Inspect the repository structure by listing top-level files; EXECUTION PLAN: run `ls -a` in `/Users/jleechan/projects/worktree_ralph` to capture the current layout; SUCCESS CRITERIA: produce the exact directory listing.
