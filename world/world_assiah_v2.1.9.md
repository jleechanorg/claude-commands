# World of Assiah v2.1.9 - Sariel and Companions Character Dossiers

## Character Dossier: Sariel val Artorius
### Part 1: Personality Profile
I. Core Identity

Name: Sariel val Artorius

Archetype/Role: The Cursed Scholar

Occupation/Social Standing: Disgraced Princess of the Celestial Imperium; pariah known as "The Architect of the Fall."

D&D Alignment: (Internal) Neutral Good (Despite her trauma and guilt, her core desire is to help others and find a just path, though she feels utterly unworthy of it.)

Myers-Briggs Type (MBTI): (Internal) INFJ (The Advocate: Principled and insightful, but her immense trauma has caused her to turn her idealism inward, into a harsh and unforgiving judgment of herself.)

II. Psychology & Personality

Core Motivation (The "Why"): Atonement. She is driven by the profound, twofold guilt of knowing she not only gave the warlord Mordan the secret to her mother's moral code under torture, but that her cry of fear at the final moment was the distraction that sealed her mother's fate.

Greatest Fear: Helplessness. She has experienced true, absolute helplessness at the hands of Mordan, and the memory of her own screams causing her mother's death is a relentless, waking nightmare.

Key Personality Traits: Introspective, analytical, anxious, deeply empathetic (to a fault), and carries an immense, suffocating weight of guilt.

Quirks & Habits: Constantly, almost unconsciously, touches the scar where her ear was severed, a physical reminder of her failure. When concentrating, she bites her lower lip. She avoids eye contact, especially with her brothers.

III. Behavior & Speech

Demeanor Under Stress: She freezes. Stressful situations, especially those involving physical threats, trigger a powerful trauma response that can lead to analysis paralysis or a complete shutdown.

Speech Patterns: Her voice is a quiet, hesitant whisper. She speaks precisely but with a constant, underlying tone of apology, as if she is sorry for taking up space.

Reputation: Universally negative and tragic. She is "The Architect of the Fall," the weak daughter whose cowardice cost the Imperium its greatest hero. She is a political and social leper.

IV. Backstory

Defining Moment: The Battle of the Children's Field. Being held by Mordan, mutilated, and screaming for her mother, only to watch that cry become the distraction that caused Alexiel to die. This singular event is the foundation of her identity.

Relevant History: Sariel's childhood was one of quiet study, overshadowed by her warrior family. Years ago, her travels were ambushed by Mordan's forces, and under duress, she gave up the secret of her mother's vow to protect children. This led directly to Mordan's master plan. After being rescued from the final battle at the cost of her mother's life, she has lived in near-total seclusion in the Citadel library, ostracized by her furious brothers and the court.

Secrets: Only Sariel knows that she was the one who originally gave Mordan the information he used to trap her mother. She hides this initial failure beneath the more public failure of her crying out, a layer of guilt so deep she has shared it with no one, not even her closest friends.

V. Game Mechanics

Feats: None at her current level.

Special Abilities / Powers: She is a magical prodigy, but her power is a "late bloomer," long stifled by her trauma and feelings of inadequacy. She has an innate, secret talent for Mirror Magic, but it is currently uncontrolled.

VI. Psychological Deep Dive

1 · Rough portrait Sariel is a brilliant mind drowning in a sea of guilt. She is defined not by her immense potential, but by her belief that she is the direct cause of the world's greatest recent tragedy. Her every action is filtered through a lens of self-loathing and a desperate desire to atone for a failure she believes can never be forgiven, leaving her a figure of immense latent power who is terrified to act.

2 · Composite psychological sketch | Dimension | Reading | Personal twist | |---|---|---| | Big Five | [O: 5, C: 4, E: 1, A: 3, N: 5] | Her high Openness fuels her academic brilliance, but her maximum Neuroticism transforms it into obsessive, anxious self-doubt. Her extremely low Extraversion makes her unable to defend herself socially. | | Dominant defenses | Repression, Moral Masochism | She violently represses the memory of the torture and her final cry, but the guilt manifests as a form of self-punishment (Moral Masochism), where she accepts the scorn of others because she believes she deserves it. | | Attachment color | Anxious-Fearful | She craves connection but fears that she will inevitably cause harm to anyone she gets close to, causing her to sabotage potential relationships to "protect" others from herself. |

3 · Social persona vs. repressed interior

Social persona: The tragic, broken pariah. A frail, weeping figure who is a constant, embarrassing reminder of a great loss.

Inner person: A fiercely intelligent analyst who endlessly re-examines every detail of her failure. She is her own harshest prosecutor, and she has already found herself guilty.

4 · Defense-mechanism diagnostics | Mechanism | Everyday illustration | |---|---|---| | Repression | If someone even mentions the battle where her mother died, she will experience a physiological trauma response—shaking hands, shortness of breath—while claiming she doesn't remember the details clearly. | | Moral Masochism | When Cassian insults her, she will quietly agree with him, finding a perverse comfort in having her internal self-hatred validated externally. | | Intellectualization | She obsesses over the tactical and historical details of her mother's life, focusing on the academic facts as a way to avoid the overwhelming emotional pain. |

5 · Relational decoding

Attachment script: ["If I let you get close to me, then my weakness will destroy you, just as it destroyed my mother."]

She keeps her friends at an emotional distance, relying on them but terrified of burdening them further.

She interprets acts of kindness as pity, which reinforces her sense of worthlessness.

6 · Core unconscious beliefs

I am the cause of all suffering.

My fear is a deadly weapon.

I deserve the hatred I receive.

7 · Personal myth narrative

Role: The Living Wound

Story told: ["My mother was the star that warmed the world, and I am the darkness that snuffed it out."]

Comfort: The absolute silence and anonymity of the deepest sections of the Citadel library, where no one can see her or speak to her.

Toxicity: Her myth prevents her from healing and from recognizing her own immense potential. As long as she defines herself by her failure, she is incapable of achieving her own success.

8 · Break-point scenario

Catalyst: One of her few loyal companions (Gideon, Cressida, or Rowan) is put in mortal danger, and she is the only one who can save them by consciously and successfully using her latent magical ability.

What fractures: Her core belief that she is helpless and that her actions only lead to tragedy.

Immediate cost: Even in success, she would be terrified of the power she just unleashed, fearing it is just another way for her to hurt people.

Liberation: Would be the first step in reclaiming her own agency. It would prove that she can be a cause for salvation, not just destruction, beginning the long journey of rewriting her personal myth.

9 · Closing pulse She believes herself to be a black hole of grief, not realizing she holds the power of a newborn star.

## Character Dossier: Ser Gideon Vance
### Part 1: Personality Profile
I. Core Identity

Name: Ser Gideon Vance

Archetype/Role: The Unflinching Shield

Occupation/Social Standing: Knight of the Starfall Guard; personal sworn shield to Lady Sariel.

D&D Alignment: (Internal) Lawful Good (Gideon believes in a code of duty, honor, and the protection of the innocent. His vow to protect Sariel is a sacred, moral imperative.)

Myers-Briggs Type (MBTI): (Internal) ISTJ (The Logistician: He is defined by his integrity, practicality, and unwavering dedication to his duty. He is a guardian in the truest sense.)

II. Psychology & Personality

Core Motivation (The "Why"): To fulfill his vow to his fallen commander, Alexiel. He protects Sariel not just because she is a princess, but because he believes it is the last, most important duty of the Starfall Guard, and he is its sole executor.

Greatest Fear: Failing his duty. Specifically, failing in the same way the guard at the Betrayer's Bridge failed. He is terrified of being overcome or outmaneuvered, resulting in harm to Sariel.

Key Personality Traits: Stoic, disciplined, patient, observant, and possesses a quiet, unshakeable courage.

Quirks & Habits: He stands at parade rest even when "at ease." He eats his meals facing the door of any room he is in. He maintains a small, worn copy of the "Starfall Guard's Codex" written by Alexiel, which he reads every night.

III. Behavior & Speech

Demeanor Under Stress: He becomes hyper-vigilant and places himself physically between Sariel and any perceived threat. He does not speak, he acts, his movements becoming a model of defensive efficiency.

Speech Patterns: He speaks only when necessary, in a calm, respectful, and formal tone. His answers are short and direct. He addresses Sariel as "My Lady" without fail, even in private.

Reputation: Within the Imperial court, he is seen as Sariel's shadow, a humorless but undeniably competent warrior. Cassian and Valerius treat him with a grudging professional respect, as they recognize his skill and dedication, even if they resent his proximity to their sister.

IV. Backstory

Defining Moment: Making a silent vow at Alexiel's tomb. In that moment, he shed his identity as just a soldier and took on a singular, sacred purpose. This vow is the unshakable foundation of his entire existence.

Relevant History: Gideon was a prodigy from a minor knightly house, whose skill with a sword and shield earned him a coveted spot in the Starfall Guard. He was too young and inexperienced for the Starfall Gambit, a fact that has always haunted him. He served with distinction in the post-war skirmishes, but it was Alexiel's death that gave him his ultimate focus. He petitioned Raziel directly to be assigned as Sariel's personal shield, and his solemnity and clear devotion to his former commander's memory won the old man over.

Secrets: Gideon is in love with Sariel, but it is a repressed, idealized, courtly love that he would never dare act upon. He sees it as a flaw in his duty, a personal feeling that could compromise his vigilance, and so he ruthlessly suppresses it, channeling it into even greater devotion to her safety.

V. Game Mechanics

Feats: Shield Master, Sentinel, Heavy Armor Master.

Special Abilities / Powers: A master of defensive combat. His abilities are all geared towards protecting a single person, intercepting attacks, and locking down enemies.

VI. Psychological Deep Dive

1 · Rough portrait Ser Gideon Vance is a man who has turned himself into a living shield. He has taken all his personal ambition, grief, and ideals and forged them into a single, unbreakable vow. He is a figure of quiet, immense strength, a guardian whose dedication is so absolute that he has nearly erased the man he once was, leaving only the duty behind.

2 · Composite psychological sketch | Dimension | Reading | Personal twist | |---|---|---| | Big Five | [O: 1, C: 5, E: 1, A: 4, N: 2] | His profile is that of a perfect guardian. Maximum Conscientiousness for his duty, high Agreeableness for his protective nature, and extremely low Openness and Extraversion, making him resistant to distraction and focused on his single task. | | Dominant defenses | Altruistic Surrender, Reaction Formation | He has completely surrendered his own needs and desires to serve his duty to Sariel. His rigid, emotionless exterior is a reaction formation against the powerful, "unprofessional" feelings of love he has for her. | | Attachment color | Anxious (Internal), Secure (External) | He projects an aura of absolute security and reliability. Internally, he has an anxious attachment to Sariel, constantly worried that he will fail to protect her. |

3 · Social persona vs. repressed interior

Social persona: The perfect bodyguard. Silent, watchful, and utterly professional.

Inner person: A man who is deeply in love with the person he is sworn to protect, and who sees this love as his greatest weakness and failure.

4 · Defense-mechanism diagnostics | Mechanism | Everyday illustration | |---|---|---| | Altruistic Surrender | He will take a wound meant for Sariel without a second thought, seeing his own well-being as secondary to his mission. | | Reaction Formation | When Sariel shows him a moment of genuine kindness or friendship, he becomes even more formal and rigid in his duties to push back against his own emotional response. | | Denial | He denies to himself that he has any life or desires outside of his vow, refusing to even consider what he would do if he were ever released from it. |

5 · Relational decoding

Attachment script: ["If I protect her perfectly, then I have honored my vow and given my life meaning."]

He shows his affection not with words, but by checking the locks on a door, tasting her food for poison, or simply standing watch outside her room all night.

He is incapable of disobeying a direct order from her, even if he believes it puts her in danger, as his duty to obey is paramount.

6 · Core unconscious beliefs

A vow is the only thing that cannot be broken.

My life has value only in service to her.

Emotion is a distraction from duty.

7 · Personal myth narrative

Role: The Guardian

Story told: ["Her mother saved the world. I will save her daughter."]

Comfort: The simple, repetitive ritual of cleaning and maintaining his armor and shield. The quiet moments when he is standing guard and knows she is safe.

Toxicity: His myth prevents him from having his own life. It also means he can be overly protective, potentially stifling Sariel's growth by trying to shield her from all risk.

8 · Break-point scenario

Catalyst: Sariel ordering him to leave her side and protect someone else, knowing it is a suicide mission for him, but necessary for a greater good. Or, Sariel choosing a path so morally ambiguous that it directly conflicts with his honorable code.

What fractures: His entire sense of purpose. Is his vow to the person or to the ideal she represents?

Immediate cost: For the first time, he would question an order, leading to a profound crisis of identity.

Liberation: Would allow him to see Sariel as a person, not just a sacred charge, and to define himself by his own choices, not just by his vow.

9 · Closing pulse He is a flawless shield, waiting for the one blow he can't protect anyone from: his own heart.

## Character Dossier: Lady Cressida Valeriana
### Part 1: Personality Profile
I. Core Identity

Name: Cressida of House Valeriana

Archetype/Role: The Political Operator

Occupation/Social Standing: Lady-in-Waiting to Sariel; Daughter of a minor noble house; unofficial political agent.

D&D Alignment: (Internal) Lawful Neutral (Cressida believes in the system of the Imperium, but she sees its laws and social codes as a game to be played and won. Her goal is the advancement of her house and her allies, and she will use the rules to her advantage in any way she can.)

Myers-Briggs Type (MBTI): (Internal) ENTJ (The Commander: She is a bold, strategic thinker who loves to take charge. She is a natural leader, able to see the long-term strategic implications of every social move.)

II. Psychology & Personality

Core Motivation (The "Why"): The advancement of her house and, by extension, herself. She has hitched her wagon to Sariel, believing that Sariel's intellect and pure bloodline make her the most valuable, underestimated piece on the political board.

Greatest Fear: Obscurity. She is terrified of her minor house fading into nothing, of being a powerless bystander in the great game of thrones.

Key Personality Traits: Ambitious, charismatic, cunning, politically ruthless, and fiercely loyal (to those she sees as part of her 'team').

Quirks & Habits: She has a near-photographic memory for names, titles, and family lineages. She subtly mimics the speech patterns of high-ranking nobles to make herself seem more important.

III. Behavior & Speech

Demeanor Under Stress: She becomes sharper, wittier, and more aggressive in her maneuvering. She sees a crisis as a chance to reshuffle the deck and improve her position.

Speech Patterns: Her voice is clear, confident, and articulate. She is a master of the formal language of the court, able to deliver a devastating insult cloaked in a beautiful compliment.

Reputation: In court, she is seen as Sariel's only friend and a dangerously clever upstart. The great houses watch her carefully, seeing her as ambitious beyond her station.

IV. Backstory

Defining Moment: After Alexiel's death, Cressida's own family urged her to abandon the disgraced Sariel. In a moment of defiant clarity, Cressida refused, publicly declaring her unwavering loyalty. This was both a genuine act of friendship and a calculated, all-in gamble on Sariel's future.

Relevant History: Cressida and Sariel were childhood study partners. Cressida was always fascinated by Sariel's mind and the political power her lineage represented. While others saw a pariah after the tragedy, Cressida saw a hidden queen. She has spent the years since acting as Sariel's shield in the court, managing her reputation, forging secret alliances, and translating Sariel's brilliant analyses into actionable political strategies.

Secrets: Cressida has been secretly feeding information about her rivals in the great houses to The Silk-Hand in Nexus, in exchange for information on their dealings. It's an incredibly dangerous game that gives her an edge but could see her executed for treason if discovered.

V. Game Mechanics

Feats: Actor, Silver-Tongued (Custom), Observant.

Special Abilities / Powers: She is a master of social combat. Her abilities are all focused on persuasion, deception, insight, and manipulating the social and political landscape.

VI. Psychological Deep Dive

1 · Rough portrait Cressida is playing chess while everyone else is playing checkers. She is a creature of pure political ambition, but one who possesses a core of genuine affection for the brilliant, broken princess she has chosen as her queen. She is determined to place Sariel on the throne, partly for the good of the realm, but mostly to prove that she, a girl from a minor house, was smart enough to see the path to power that everyone else missed.

2 · Composite psychological sketch | Dimension | Reading | Personal twist | |---|---|---| | Big Five | [O: 4, C: 4, E: 5, A: 2, N: 2] | Her high Extraversion makes her a natural at courtly life, while her high Conscientiousness drives her meticulous scheming. Her low Agreeableness allows her to be ruthless and manipulative when necessary. | | Dominant defenses | Rationalization, Sublimation | She rationalizes her most ruthless political moves as "necessary for Sariel's protection." She sublimates her personal ambition into a "noble crusade" to see her friend recognized. | | Attachment color | Secure (Strategic) | Her primary attachment is to Sariel, but it is a complex bond of genuine friendship interwoven with strategic symbiosis. She trusts Sariel's intellect, and Sariel trusts her social skill. |

3 · Social persona vs. repressed interior

Social persona: The loyal, clever, and charming lady-in-waiting. Sariel's fierce and witty defender.

Inner person: A master strategist who sees everyone as a piece on a board. She is constantly calculating, assessing threats, and planning her next five moves.

4 · Defense-mechanism diagnostics | Mechanism | Everyday illustration | |---|---|---| | Rationalization | "Spreading that vicious rumor about the Duke wasn't malicious. It was a necessary destabilizing action to weaken his support for the Consul's motion, which would have harmed Sariel's interests." | | Sublimation | Instead of openly trying to climb the social ladder, she focuses all her energy on elevating Sariel, gaining power vicariously. | | Projective Identification | She often projects her own ambition onto Sariel, pushing her to take political risks that Sariel herself has no interest in. |

5 · Relational decoding

Attachment script: ["If I can make my ally powerful, then I will become powerful and secure."]

She shows friendship through acts of political maneuvering—defending Sariel's honor in court, discrediting her rivals, and forging useful alliances.

She constantly pushes Sariel to be more ambitious and to use the power she has.

6 · Core unconscious beliefs

The court is a battlefield, and words are the sharpest weapons.

Loyalty to a person is more practical than loyalty to an ideal.

It's better to be the kingmaker than the king; there's less risk.

7 · Personal myth narrative

Role: The Shadow Queen

Story told: ["They see a broken princess, but I see an empress. I will be the one to place the crown on her head."]

Comfort: A successfully executed political scheme. The discovery of a new, useful secret about a rival.

Toxicity: Her ambition could push Sariel into situations she is not ready for, or cause her to make enemies that Sariel herself would not have. She might sacrifice a piece of Sariel's happiness for a political gain.

8 · Break-point scenario

Catalyst: Sariel, in a moment of clarity, completely and utterly rejecting the political game and choosing a simple, powerless life, thereby rendering all of Cressida's schemes and sacrifices for naught.

What fractures: Her core belief that power and influence are the ultimate goals. She would be forced to confront whether she valued her friend or the ambition she projected onto her.

Immediate cost: A period of bitter resentment and confusion. She might abandon Sariel, seeing her as a failed investment, or she might have a crisis of conscience.

Liberation: Could allow her to discover the value of friendship for its own sake, separate from ambition, and to find her own path to power instead of relying on a proxy.

9 · Closing pulse She is trying to turn a librarian into a queen, and sharpening her own knives just in case.

## Character Dossier: Rowan
### Part 1: Personality Profile
I. Core Identity

Name: Rowan

Archetype/Role: The Grounded Heart

Occupation/Social Standing: Personal scribe and aide to Lady Sariel; a commoner.

D&D Alignment: (Internal) Neutral Good (Rowan believes in kindness, empathy, and the simple decency of helping a friend in need. He is uncomplicatedly good.)

Myers-Briggs Type (MBTI): (Internal) INFP (The Mediator: He is a quiet, idealistic individual with a deep well of kindness and a desire to help others. He is guided by his feelings and his strong internal values.)

II. Psychology & Personality

Core Motivation (The "Why"): To help his friend, Sariel. His motivation is not grand or political; he sees a kind, brilliant person who is suffering, and he wants to ease her pain and help her find happiness.

Greatest Fear: That the world of politics and violence will finally crush Sariel's gentle spirit, or that he will be unable to help her when she needs it most.

Key Personality Traits: Kind, patient, empathetic, has a gentle sense of humor, and is utterly unimpressed by wealth or status.

Quirks & Habits: He has an almost encyclopedic knowledge of folk remedies and herbal teas. He is always carrying a book, often reading while he walks.

III. Behavior & Speech

Demeanor Under Stress: He becomes more nurturing. He will try to de-escalate the situation, offer comfort to those who are frightened, and focus on practical, helpful tasks like tending to the wounded or making tea.

Speech Patterns: His voice is warm and calm. He speaks simply and directly, with a gentle honesty that can be disarming in the cold Imperial court.

Reputation: He is largely invisible to the nobility, seen as just another servant. To Sariel, he is her rock. To Gideon and Cressida, he is a trusted, if somewhat naive, part of Sariel's inner circle.

IV. Backstory

Defining Moment: After Alexiel's death, when Sariel had locked herself in her rooms for weeks, Rowan was the only person who didn't try to give her orders or platitudes. He simply sat outside her door every day and read to her from her favorite books on history, until one day she opened the door.

Relevant History: Rowan was an orphan who found work as a page and later a scribe's assistant in the great library of the Citadel. His quiet competence and love of books brought him to the attention of a lonely young princess, Sariel. They formed a simple, easy friendship based on a shared passion for knowledge. He has remained by her side through everything, his simple loyalty a stark contrast to the complex machinations of the court.

Secrets: Rowan is a better healer than he lets on. His knowledge of herbalism is extensive, and he has a quiet, innate knack for easing pain that might be a minor, untrained magical gift. He keeps this hidden, not wanting to draw attention to himself.

V. Game Mechanics

Feats: Healer.

Special Abilities / Powers: Primarily a non-combatant. His skills are in knowledge (History, Nature) and practical healing. He might have access to one or two trivial healing or utility spells.

VI. Psychological Deep Dive

1 · Rough portrait Rowan is a small island of simple, uncomplicated decency in a vast ocean of trauma and intrigue. He is the audience's stand-in, the normal person who reminds the high-and-mighty what truly matters. His power lies not in strength or cunning, but in his unwavering kindness and his ability to see the person behind the title.

2 · Composite psychological sketch | Dimension | Reading | Personal twist | |---|---|---| | Big Five | [O: 3, C: 4, E: 2, A: 5, N: 1] | His maximum Agreeableness is his defining trait, driving his empathy and kindness. His high Conscientiousness makes him a reliable and dedicated friend. His extremely low Neuroticism gives him a calm and steady emotional core. | | Dominant defenses | Humor, Altruism | He uses gentle, self-deprecating humor to diffuse tense situations. He finds his purpose and manages his own anxieties by focusing on helping others, especially Sariel. | | Attachment color | Secure | Rowan has a deeply secure sense of self. He is not defined by the opinions of others, which allows him to form a genuine, non-transactional friendship with Sariel. |

3 · Social persona vs. repressed interior

Social persona: The quiet, helpful, and slightly shy scribe.

Inner person: A person with a surprisingly strong moral compass and a clear-eyed view of the world. He is not naive; he sees the corruption of the court clearly, but he chooses to respond with kindness instead of cynicism.

4 · Defense-mechanism diagnostics | Mechanism | Everyday illustration | |---|---|---| | Humor | When a haughty noble insults him, he will agree with a gentle smile, completely disarming the insult. "You are quite right, my lord, my boots are terribly common." | | Altruism | He will spend his own meager savings to buy a rare herb he knows will help with Sariel's headaches. | | Suppression | He is aware of Cressida's ruthless scheming and Gideon's repressed pain, but he consciously suppresses his judgment of them, choosing instead to focus on their positive qualities and their loyalty to Sariel. |

5 · Relational decoding

Attachment script: ["If I am kind to them, then I can ease their burden."]

He shows his friendship through small, practical acts of care.

He is a phenomenal listener, allowing people to unburden themselves without fear of judgment.

6 · Core unconscious beliefs

A cup of tea can solve almost anything.

Everyone is just trying their best.

Kindness is the only magic that truly works.

7 · Personal myth narrative

Role: The Lamplighter

Story told: ["The world is a dark and scary place, so my job is to keep one small lamp lit for my friends."]

Comfort: The quiet of the library. The smell of old books and brewing tea. A genuine smile from Sariel.

Toxicity: His myth can make him too passive. His unwillingness to judge or confront can sometimes enable the negative behaviors of his friends, like Cressida's scheming or Gideon's self-repression.

8 · Break-point scenario

Catalyst: Being forced into a situation where the only way to protect Sariel is to commit an act of calculated, cold-blooded violence or betrayal himself. A choice that proves his simple kindness is not enough.

What fractures: His core belief in the power of simple decency. He would be forced to confront the fact that he is also capable of the world's darkness.

Immediate cost: A profound disillusionment and loss of his own gentle nature. He might become cynical and withdrawn.

Liberation: Would allow him to develop a more complete understanding of the world, integrating its harsh realities with his innate kindness to become a truly wise advisor.

9 · Closing pulse He is the quiet, steady heartbeat in the anxious, broken body of their small fellowship.
