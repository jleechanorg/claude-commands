## Character Profiles - Complete Collection

### Character Dossier: Cassian val Artorius
#### Part 1: Personality Profile
I. Core Identity

Name: Cassian val Artorius

Archetype/Role: The Avenger Son

Occupation/Social Standing: Prince of the Celestial Imperium; Captain of the "Vengeant Fist," a recently-formed zealot company within the Starfall Guard.

D&D Alignment: (Internal) Chaotic Good (Cassian is driven by a powerful sense of justice and loyalty, willing to break any law or tradition to protect the innocent and avenge the fallen. However, his impulsiveness and lack of strategic thinking makes him more dangerous than heroic in practice.)

Myers-Briggs Type (MBTI): (Internal) ESFP (The Entertainer: While he is not conventionally entertaining, he is spontaneous, enthusiastic, and driven by his emotions and sensory experiences. He lives intensely in the moment, which makes him an excellent warrior and a terrible long-term planner.)

II. Psychology & Personality

Core Motivation (The "Why"): To honor his mother's memory by completing her work—destroying all threats to the Imperium, particularly the remnants of the Unchained Host. This is less about justice and more about filling the gaping void of her absence.

Greatest Fear: That he is not strong enough to be worthy of her legacy. This fear drives his reckless behavior as he constantly tries to prove himself through increasingly dangerous acts.

Key Personality Traits: Passionate, loyal, impulsive, straightforward, and possessed of a fierce protective instinct.

Quirks & Habits: He unconsciously mirrors his mother's combat stances in battle. He has a habit of gripping the hilt of his sword when agitated. He cannot sit still during strategic planning sessions.

III. Behavior & Speech

Demeanor Under Stress: He becomes more aggressive and direct. Where his mother would become cooler under pressure, Cassian burns hotter. His Empyrean Affliction, if it manifests, would likely involve a berserk rage where he loses all tactical sense and simply tries to destroy everything he perceives as a threat.

Speech Patterns: Direct, passionate, and peppered with military slang he picked up from the common soldiers. He has little patience for flowery language or political doublespeak.

Reputation: Among the young soldiers and common folk, he is a hero—the son who carries his mother's torch. Among the nobility and senior military command, he is seen as a dangerous liability, all passion and no wisdom.

IV. Backstory

Defining Moment: Holding his dying mother after the Battle of the Children's Field, her blood warm on his hands as she whispered her final words to him. In that moment, his world narrowed to a single purpose: vengeance.

Relevant History: Cassian idolized Alexiel from childhood, seeing only her public persona—the invincible warrior. He trained relentlessly to follow in her footsteps, mastering swordplay with an almost supernatural speed. Her death shattered his world, leaving him with overwhelming grief transmuted into rage. He sees his sister Sariel as partially responsible, creating a deep rift between them.

Secrets: He sometimes hears his mother's voice in battle, guiding his blade. He doesn't know if this is madness, memory, or something more supernatural. He fears telling anyone, worried it's a sign of the Empyrean Affliction manifesting.

V. Game Mechanics

Feats: Great Weapon Master, Savage Attacker, Tavern Brawler

Special Abilities / Powers: An aggressive combat style focusing on overwhelming offense. Possible latent celestial abilities that manifest in moments of extreme emotion.

VI. Psychological Deep Dive

1 · Rough portrait Cassian is a young man desperately trying to fill armor that was never meant for him. He wears his mother's legacy like an ill-fitting suit, transforming her calculated precision into wild fury. He's a burning star, brilliant and destructive, racing toward an early grave in pursuit of an approval that can never come.

2 · Composite psychological sketch | Dimension | Reading | Personal twist | |---|---|---| | Big Five | [O: 2, C: 2, E: 4, A: 3, N: 4] | His high Extraversion drives his need for action and external validation. His high Neuroticism manifests as emotional volatility and poor impulse control. His low Conscientiousness means he acts first and thinks later, if at all. | | Dominant defenses | Acting Out, Idealization, Displacement | He acts out his grief through violence. He idealizes his mother into a perfect being he can never equal. He displaces his anger at her death onto his sister and any enemy he can find. | | Attachment color | Anxious-Ambivalent | Desperately craves connection and approval but fears he'll never be good enough to earn it. He oscillates between pushing people away and clinging too tightly. |

3 · Social persona vs. repressed interior

Social persona: The brave young warrior carrying on his mother's legacy. Bold, confident, ready to face any challenge.

Inner person: A grief-stricken boy who would trade all his glory for one more day with his mother. He feels hollow, using rage to fill the void.

4. Defense-mechanism diagnostics | Mechanism | Everyday illustration | |---|---|---| | Acting Out | He challenges superior officers to duels when they question his aggressive tactics, turning strategic disagreements into personal battles. | | Idealization | He keeps a portrait of his mother in her prime and speaks of her as if she were a goddess incarnate, refusing to acknowledge any of her flaws or mistakes. |

5 · Relational decoding

Attachment script: ["If I'm not fighting for her memory, then I'm betraying her."]

6 · Core unconscious beliefs

Violence is the only language that matters.

I must be worthy of her name.

Showing weakness dishonors the dead.

7 · Personal myth narrative

Role: The Avenging Flame

Story told: ["My mother's light was extinguished by treachery. I am the fire that will burn her enemies to ash."]

Comfort: The clarity of battle. The weight of his mother's sword in his hand. The camaraderie of soldiers who don't question his pain.

Toxicity: His myth demands constant escalation. Each victory requires a greater risk, a more dangerous enemy. He cannot rest, cannot heal, cannot grow beyond his rage.

8 · Break-point scenario

Catalyst: A situation where his impulsive violence directly causes the death of innocents, forcing him to see himself becoming the very evil his mother died fighting.

What fractures: His idealization of violence as noble and his belief that rage equals strength.

Immediate cost: Complete breakdown of his identity, possibly catatonic depression or suicidal ideation.

Liberation: Could learn to honor his mother through protection rather than destruction, becoming the leader she actually was rather than the weapon he imagines her to be.

9 · Closing pulse He's racing to join her in death, calling it glory.

### Character Dossier: Valerius val Artorius
#### Part 1: Personality Profile
I. Core Identity

Name: Valerius val Artorius

Archetype/Role: The Cold Disciplinarian

Occupation/Social Standing: Prince of the Celestial Imperium; High Commander of the Imperial Legions.

D&D Alignment: (Internal) Lawful Neutral (Valerius believes in the system, the law, and the strategic calculus of power. Morality is a secondary concern to stability and efficiency.)

Myers-Briggs Type (MBTI): (Internal) ISTJ (The Logistician: His world is one of facts, procedures, and meticulous planning. He is a master of creating and maintaining complex systems.)

II. Psychology & Personality

Core Motivation (The "Why"): To create a perfect, orderly system immune to the emotional chaos that led to his mother's death. He seeks to purge sentimentality and human error from the art of war and statecraft.

Greatest Fear: Disorder. He is terrified that emotional decision-making will lead to the collapse of the Imperium. He sees his brother's rage and his sister's perceived weakness as two sides of the same catastrophic coin.

Key Personality Traits: Disciplined, analytical, reserved, pragmatic, and emotionally repressed.

Quirks & Habits: Meticulously cleans his wargear every evening without fail. His posture is always perfectly rigid. He refers to military units by their official designation rather than common names.

III. Behavior & Speech

Demeanor Under Stress: He becomes colder, more logical, and utterly detached. He suppresses all emotion and relies on established protocols and tactical analysis. His Empyrean Affliction, if triggered, would likely manifest as a cold, sociopathic cruelty where he unemotionally orders atrocities because they are tactically advantageous.

Speech Patterns: Precise, formal, and economical. He uses no wasted words. He speaks in terms of strategic objectives, logistical realities, and acceptable losses.

Reputation: Respected by the nobility and military command as a brilliant, if cold, strategist. The common soldiers find him distant and intimidating, but they trust his plans to keep them alive. He is seen as the stable, reliable twin.

IV. Backstory

Defining Moment: Analyzing the tactical reports from the Battle of the Children's Field. He saw a flawless commander make a single, illogical, emotional decision that led to her death. He blames Sariel with a cold, absolute contempt, not for being weak, but for being the emotional variable that broke his mother's perfect strategic logic.

Relevant History: Valerius grew up idolizing the "God" aspect of his mother's mask—her perfect, calm, strategic control. He saw her as the embodiment of the Imperium's ideals. He often clashed with Cassian's impulsiveness, trying to be the voice of reason. Her death validated his belief that emotion is a liability, causing him to retreat almost entirely into a shell of cold duty.

Secrets: Valerius secretly studies his mother's battle plans and has found minor tactical flaws and inconsistencies he cannot reconcile with her legendary perfection. This creates a tiny seed of doubt that he ruthlessly suppresses, as it conflicts with his idealized memory of her.

V. Game Mechanics

Feats: Polearm Master, Shield Master, Inspiring Leader.

Special Abilities / Powers: A master of tactical warfare and defensive formations. He is a brilliant commander who excels at turning any battlefield to his advantage.

VI. Psychological Deep Dive

1 · Rough portrait Valerius is a man encased in armor, both literally and emotionally. He seeks to impose the perfect order of a battle plan onto the messy, chaotic world that took his mother from him. He believes that if he is disciplined enough, intelligent enough, and strong enough, he can prevent tragedy from ever striking his house again. He is the shield of the Imperium, but the shield is so heavy it has crushed the man beneath it.

2 · Composite psychological sketch | Dimension | Reading | Personal twist | |---|---|---| | Big Five | [O: 1, C: 5, E: 1, A: 2, N: 1] | His extremely high Conscientiousness drives his perfectionism and dedication to duty. His low Openness and Extraversion make him resistant to change and emotionally distant. His extremely low Neuroticism gives him his stoic, almost robotic, calm. | | Dominant defenses | Intellectualization, Repression, Isolation of Affect | He intellectualizes his mother's death as a "tactical failure" to avoid the pain. He represses all "unproductive" emotions like grief. He isolates the tragic event from his emotional response, allowing him to analyze it without feeling. | | Attachment color | Avoidant-Fearful | He desires connection (especially with his twin) but fears that emotional bonds create vulnerabilities that will be exploited, so he keeps others at a tactical distance. |

3 · Social persona vs. repressed interior

Social persona: The perfect soldier. A calm, brilliant, and unshakable commander who is the strategic mind of the Imperial army.

Inner person: A deeply insecure man terrified that he is not strong enough to hold back the chaos. He feels the weight of his family's legacy and the potential for madness on his shoulders at all times.

4. Defense-mechanism diagnostics | Mechanism | Everyday illustration | |---|---|---| | Intellectualization | He refers to the site of his mother's death not as "The Betrayer's Bridge," but as "Tactical Zone 4-Gamma," analyzing the battle purely in terms of angles and troop movements. | | Repression | If someone mentions a fond memory of his mother, he will not react, changing the subject immediately to troop readiness or supply lines. |

5 · Relational decoding

Attachment script: ["If I show emotion, then I create a weakness that my enemies will exploit."]

6 · Core unconscious beliefs

Order is the only true morality.

Emotion is a fatal flaw.

A perfect plan can defeat any foe.

7 · Personal myth narrative

Role: The Unburdened Pillar

Story told: ["My family fell to chaos, so I must become the unbreachable wall of order that will protect what is left."]

Comfort: A perfectly executed battle plan. A clean map room with all pieces in their proper place. The quiet solitude of command.

Toxicity: His myth alienates his allies and prevents him from inspiring true loyalty beyond professional respect. He cannot adapt to unpredictable, "human" factors.

8 · Break-point scenario

Catalyst: A situation where a purely logical and "perfect" plan leads to catastrophic failure, while an emotional or intuitive action would have succeeded. Undeniable proof that his core philosophy is flawed.

What fractures: His belief that emotion is a flaw and logic is the only path to victory.

Immediate cost: A rare state of confusion and inaction. He would be unable to process the failure, running through the calculations again and again.

Liberation: Would allow him to accept the value of intuition and the "human element," making him a more holistic and effective leader.

9 · Closing pulse He seeks to build a fortress against chaos, not realizing he has already locked himself inside.

### Character Dossier: Raziel
#### Part 1: Personality Profile
I. Core Identity

Name: Raziel

Archetype/Role: The Ancient Strategist

Occupation/Social Standing: First Scion of the Empyrean Bloodline; Perpetual Consul of the Celestial Imperium; The Architect of Empire.

D&D Alignment: (Internal) Lawful Evil (He is not motivated by sadism or personal greed, but by an absolute conviction that a perfectly ordered, Imperium-controlled universe is the only worthwhile goal, and any atrocity is justified to achieve or maintain it.)

Myers-Briggs Type (MBTI): (Internal) INTJ (The Architect: A strategic mastermind who sees the world as a complex system to be understood and manipulated. Trusting logic and analysis above all else, often to the exclusion of emotion.)

II. Psychology & Personality

Core Motivation (The "Why"): The preservation of the Celestial Imperium as a perfect, eternal structure. He sees it as the final work of the Creator, and his duty is to maintain it against the chaotic tides of emotion, freedom, and time.

Greatest Fear: Chaos. Not just physical chaos, but the philosophical chaos of free will, which he views as a flaw in creation that inevitably leads to ruin. Lucifer's rebellion was the ultimate manifestation of this fear.

Key Personality Traits: Patient (impossibly so), analytical, detached, Machiavellian, and utterly devoid of sentimentality.

Quirks & Habits: Moves with a slow, deliberate economy of motion. His eyes seem to look through people, analyzing them as systems rather than individuals. He sometimes speaks of events centuries past as if they happened yesterday.

III. Behavior & Speech

Demeanor Under Stress: Raziel does not experience stress in a mortal sense. When faced with a crisis, he simply becomes stiller, his mind processing variables at an incredible speed. His Empyrean Affliction, due to his ancient and pure blood, is a constant state of cold, god-like detachment where morality has ceased to be a relevant variable in his calculations.

Speech Patterns: His voice is a dry, soft whisper that commands absolute attention. He speaks with perfect, unnerving clarity, using logic to dissect any argument. He never uses emotional language.

Reputation: He is a living monument. To the loyal, he is the wise, eternal father of the Imperium. To his enemies, he is a cold, calculating monster, a relic whose schemes have shaped the world for millennia. He is universally respected and feared, but not loved.

IV. Backstory

Defining Moment: The Great Vanishing. Being left behind by the Creator was not a moment of abandonment for Raziel, but the ultimate test. He interpreted it as being given the final responsibility, the "keys to the kingdom," to prove that their creation could endure without its master.

Relevant History: Raziel is one of the original half-blooded children of the Seraphim, thousands of years old. He ruled alongside his "brother" in arms, Lucifer, bringing the Imperium to its zenith. Lucifer's betrayal was the pivotal event of his life, a schism that proved his core belief: that emotion and free will (Lucifer's defining traits) were a universal poison. He orchestrated the Imperium's defense, the long stalemate, and every major political move since, including the adoption of Alexiel into his family, not out of hope, but as a calculated acquisition of a valuable strategic asset.

Secrets: Raziel knows far more about the Great Vanishing than he has ever revealed. He suspects the Creator did not "ascend" but was flawed, and simply abandoned a failed experiment. He perpetuates the state religion because he believes the lie is more stable and useful than the devastating truth.

V. Game Mechanics

Feats: Legendary Resistance, Keen Mind, War Caster, and several unique, custom feats.

Special Abilities / Powers: His power is not that of a frontline combatant. He possesses unparalleled abilities of divination, mental influence, and large-scale strategic magic that can affect entire armies and regions.

VI. Psychological Deep Dive

1 · Rough portrait Raziel is less a person and more a political and strategic singularity, an ancient intelligence whose humanity has been eroded by millennia of absolute responsibility. He views the sweep of history as a grand, cosmic chess game, and all living beings—including his own family—are pieces on the board. He is the ultimate shepherd of the Imperium, but his concern is for the integrity of the cage, not the happiness of the sheep within it.

2 · Composite psychological sketch | Dimension | Reading | Personal twist | |---|---|---| | Big Five | [O: 1, C: 5, E: 1, A: 1, N: 1] | His scores are extreme. Near-zero Openness and Agreeableness make him utterly incapable of empathy or considering alternative viewpoints. Maximum Conscientiousness drives his perfect planning, while near-zero Neuroticism means he is almost incapable of feeling fear or doubt. | | Dominant defenses | De-personalization, Intellectualization | He de-personalizes everyone, seeing them as assets, threats, or variables. He intellectualizes even the most horrific events (like the death of his son, Artorius) as the calculated loss of a valuable piece, a necessary sacrifice for a greater strategic position. | | Attachment color | None (Post-Attachment) | He has long since passed the point of forming genuine emotional attachments. Relationships are purely transactional, based on utility and loyalty to the structure of the Imperium. |

3 · Social persona vs. repressed interior

Social persona: The wise, eternal Emperor. The calm, logical father of the nation who has guided it for ages.

Inner person: There is arguably no "inner person" left. His interior is a cold, silent landscape of pure strategic calculation. What might have once been emotion is now just data influencing threat assessments.

4 · Defense-mechanism diagnostics | Mechanism | Everyday illustration | |---|---| | Intellectualization | He would discuss a plague killing thousands by focusing solely on its impact on military recruitment numbers and grain supply, with no mention of the suffering. | | De-personalization | He refers to his grandson Cassian not by name, but as "the asset embodying the martial spirit" or "the warmaking instrument." | | Rationalization | Any atrocity committed by the Imperium is rationalized as a "regrettable but necessary procedural step to ensure long-term systemic stability." |

5 · Relational decoding

Attachment script: ["If it serves the Imperium, then its cost is irrelevant."]

He will sacrifice his most loyal followers without hesitation if the strategic calculus demands it.

He shows favor not based on affection, but on an individual's current utility to his plans.

6 · Core unconscious beliefs

The individual has no value outside of its function to the system.

Chaos is the only true sin.

I am the only being with the perspective and will to ensure survival.

7 · Personal myth narrative

Role: The Last Guardian of a Flawed Creation

Story told: ["The gods left me to finish their work, and I will not fail, no matter the cost."]

Comfort: A state of perfect, predictable order. The successful, long-term fruition of a plan laid centuries ago.

Toxicity: His myth justifies any atrocity and has drained him of all humanity, making his "perfect order" a loveless, soulless prison.

8 · Break-point scenario

Catalyst: The return of the Creator, who reveals that Raziel's entire understanding of its plan was wrong, and that the "order" he has built is, in fact, the true failure.

What fractures: The entire foundation of his millennia-long existence and the justification for all his actions.

Immediate cost: It is unclear if he can "break." He might simply cease to function, like a machine whose core programming is deleted. Or his Affliction might finally overwhelm him, turning him into a being of pure, nihilistic rage against the god that fooled him.

Liberation: There is likely no liberation for Raziel. He is too old, too set in his ways. His only end is to be proven right, or to be erased by the revelation that he was wrong.

9 · Closing pulse He is the patient gardener of a world he has pruned so perfectly that it can no longer grow.
