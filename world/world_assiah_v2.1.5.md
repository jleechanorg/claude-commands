# World of Assiah v2.1.5 - Alexiel's Complete Character Profiles

## Alexiel's Core Deception Strategy

### The Three-Layered Deception

#### Layer 1: The Flawed Hero (The Public Mask)
**What the World Knows**: It is public knowledge that Alexiel is a Null—a "flawed" Empyrean clone who is completely unable to use or channel magic. She is seen as the ultimate underdog: a celestial by blood but tragically cut off from her heritage. Her fame comes from being a peerless warrior who overcame her "disability" through pure physical prowess and determination, a narrative that makes her both admirable and pitiable.

**Strategic Purpose**: This public identity is the perfect camouflage. No enemy would ever formulate a strategy that involves her using any kind of magical ability. She is dismissed by magical threats and underestimated by martial ones, ensuring she is never perceived as the true strategic danger in any room.

#### Layer 2: The Suicidal Weapon (The Inner Circle's "Truth")
**What Her Inner Circle Knows**: Alexiel's closest commanders (Raziel, Artorius) know a deeper secret. Her Null status is not just a deficiency; it can be weaponized into an active Nullification Field that shuts down all magic in an area. However, Alexiel has painstakingly convinced them that unleashing this power is an act of ultimate desperation that inflicts unbearable, crippling agony upon her, effectively a suicide attack that would leave her dead or permanently broken.

**Strategic Purpose**: This lie gives her absolute control over her greatest weapon. Her own allies will refuse to deploy her "suicidal" ability except in the most apocalyptic circumstances, preventing them from ever truly understanding its nature or frequency. They believe they are protecting her, while in reality, they are preserving her trump card.

#### Layer 3: The Arcane Predator (The Ultimate Secret)
**What Only Alexiel Knew**: The truth. The crippling agony was a flawless performance. The Nullification Field has no negative effect on her whatsoever. Her deepest secret, the one that makes the others possible, is that she is a magical prodigy of immense power, and her own magic functions perfectly inside her anti-magic field.

**Strategic Purpose**: This is the perfect trap. It allowed her to create a situation—the Starfall Gambit—where she could neutralize the greatest strength of her enemies while feigning a weakness that would draw them into a fatal sense of security. She could then deploy her own, completely unexpected and unopposed, magical power to annihilate them. It is the ultimate expression of her hidden, joyful predatory nature: to win by being a monster that no one even knew could exist.

## The Truth of the Mortal Star: Alexiel's Power

### Public Knowledge: Alexiel the Null
To the world, it is known that Alexiel's cloning process was "flawed." She was born a Null—a rare type of half-celestial who is completely unable to use or channel magic, but is blessed with physical strength and martial talent far beyond most mortals. Throughout her entire career, she was seen as the ultimate brute-force warrior, a peerless swordswoman whose lack of magical ability was both her defining trait and her greatest perceived weakness. This "flaw" made her an object of pity and scorn among the magic-wielding Empyrean elite, even as they relied on her strength.

### The Hidden Reality: The Three Layers of Power
Alexiel's true power was a masterwork of lifelong deception, built on three secret layers:

**Layer 1: The Secret Mage**
Like Merlin in the old tales, Alexiel's greatest secret was that she was not a Null at all. She could not only use magic, but she was a prodigy of immense, innate talent. She kept this ability absolutely hidden, relying solely on her martial prowess in almost every battle. This made her magic the ultimate trump card, an impossible tactic that no enemy could ever anticipate or prepare for.

**Layer 2: The Nullification Field (The Feigned Burden)**
She possessed a unique and terrifying special ability: a Nullification Field. When activated, this mobile aura instantly and completely severed the connection to magical energy for everyone within it, rendering all spellcasting impossible. Critically, as part of her deception, she would feign that activating this field came at a tremendous physical cost. When the field went up, she would appear to be wracked with agony—eyes bleeding, body convulsing in pain—making her look like a crippled, vulnerable sitting duck at the center of her own power.

**Layer 3: The Untouched Predator (The True State)**
The physical agony from the Nullification Field was a complete fabrication—the final, perfect layer of her deception. The field, keyed to her unique spiritual signature, did not affect her at all. While her enemies were depowered, confused, and facing a seemingly crippled opponent, she was, in fact, completely unharmed, fully mobile, and—most importantly—the only person in the room who could still use magic.

## The Starfall Gambit: The True Story

This three-layered power is the real key to how she won the Starfall Gambit, an act of strategic genius built upon the foundation of her followers' absolute faith.

### The Preparation
Before the mission, Alexiel assembled her 30 chosen elites of the Starfall Guard. Over years of campaigning, her bond with them had become one of absolute, unquestioning faith. She gave them strange orders: they were to focus their training entirely on pure swordsmanship and physical conditioning, honing their martial skills without reliance on any magical items or support. When questioned, she said only, "Where we are going, your steel and your nerve will be your only allies. Trust in them. Trust in me."

### The Trap
Alexiel and her 30 guards stormed the Obsidian Spire. They went in fully expecting to face The Seven Apostates at the height of their magical and martial power, armed only with their blades and their loyalty.

### The Feigned Sacrifice
She activates her Nullification Field. The Apostates' immense magic instantly dies. Simultaneously, Alexiel masterfully fakes the effects of a crippling backlash, collapsing to the floor as if wracked with unbearable agony. No one had ever seen or conceived of such magic before, so her apparent self-inflicted torment was entirely believable. Seeing their primary foe helpless gave the Apostates a crucial moment of arrogant confidence, and this strong opening made all the difference.

### The Pyrrhic Victory
As the Apostates advanced on the "crippled" Alexiel, she rose, unharmed, and unleashed her own hidden magic. The battle that followed was a horrific, desperate melee. The guards engaged the seven masters with their swords, their pure martial skill honed to a razor's edge. But even so, they were outmatched. As the tide turned against them and their expert swordsmanship proved insufficient, the guards resorted to their final, unspoken duty. A warrior, about to be cut down, would abandon their blade, surging forward in a final, desperate act to grapple their far stronger opponent, a silent nod to their commander their only testament as they locked the Apostate in place for a fatal second. In those moments, Alexiel would unleash her magic, annihilating the target and the brave guard who held them fast.

### The Legend of Impossible Victory
She deactivated the field and was found as the sole survivor. To the outside world, who knew nothing of the Nullification Field, the story was a testament to a feat beyond mortal comprehension. The legend spread that Alexiel and her 30 guards had faced down the full, unrestrained magical and martial fury of The Seven Apostates and, through divine skill and impossible bravery, had won. While the Imperium celebrated her greatest victory, Alexiel would mourn the loss of her guard for the rest of her life, forever haunted by the memory of the absolute faith they placed in a plan they never understood.

## Sariel's Path to Discovery

### The Lone Survivor
There was another survivor of the Starfall Gambit—one of her 30 guards. He was not killed, but his mind was shattered by the raw psychic and magical backlash of the event, leaving him in a catatonic, seemingly insane state. To preserve the legend, Raziel had this lone witness erased from all records and hidden away in a secret Imperial sanitarium known as the "Quiet Ward."

### The Thread
In the modern day, Sariel, while researching the Empyrean Affliction to better understand her family, may stumble upon a heavily redacted medical file or a cryptic, private note from the late Magister Lucian Kantos mentioning the "Starfall Patient." By pulling on this thread, she can use her own vast intellect and her companions' skills to find the sanitarium and the sole living witness to her mother's greatest secret, beginning the journey of uncovering the true, terrifying nature of the hero everyone thought they knew.

## Alexiel's Revised Deception Strategy

### Layer 1: The Prodigal Sword (The Public Mask)
For the world, her enemies, and most allies, she is a straightforward martial prodigy. She is a brilliant, almost instinctual warrior, a "Mortal Star" who shines brightest in battle. This persona makes her seem like a powerful but manageable asset, a spear to be aimed.

### Layer 2: The Reluctant Champion (The Intimate Mask)
**Target**: Her closest relations, specifically her husband, Artorius, and later, her children.

**Method**: For those she loved, Alexiel cultivated a completely different image. She presented herself as a woman burdened and horrified by her own talent for violence. She would speak with Artorius not of the glory of battle, but of its terrible cost. She would express a deep, seemingly genuine longing for a simple, peaceful life—a farm, a quiet home—that her "duty" and "terrible skill" would forever deny her. She framed her role not as a hero, but as a tragic figure forced to bloody her hands to protect the things she truly valued: peace and family.

**Purpose**: This is a far more sophisticated deception. It engenders not just respect (like Layer 1 does), but deep love, sympathy, and a fierce desire to protect her from her own burden. A truly good man like Artorius would not fall for a simple warrior, but he would fall deeply in love with a tragic champion who hated the violence she excelled at. This persona completely shielded her cold, calculating strategic mind from the person she was closest to, making her deception absolute. It allowed her to plan wars while being seen as dreaming only of peace.

### Layer 3: The Joyful Predator (The Hidden Truth)
**Trigger**: This, her truest self, is only ever unleashed in moments of absolute desperation when all other options have failed. It is a state she both craves and is terrified of. The Starfall Gambit was the ultimate trigger.

**Method**: When this layer emerges, the masks of the simple soldier and the reluctant hero are burned away. She reveals a terrifying secret: she loves it. She feels a profound, thrilling, almost ecstatic joy in the perfect execution of strategy and violence. She revels in the intellectual superiority of outmaneuvering a foe, the visceral feedback of a perfectly aimed sword stroke, and the absolute power of dominating her enemies. Observers of this state would not see a desperate hero; they would see a predator finally unleashed, her eyes alight with a chilling, joyful intensity as she dismantles her opponents with flawless, beautiful, and terrifying precision.

**The Personal Cost & Cover Story**: The exhilaration of this state is immediately followed by a wave of crushing self-loathing and guilt. The "good" part of Alexiel is horrified by this "joyful predator" that lives inside her. This intense, cyclical guilt is what keeps her a "good/grey" person overall; she is genuinely disgusted by her own nature. Her Layer 2 "Reluctant Champion" persona is not just a mask for others, but a desperate cage she builds for herself. If ever questioned about her terrifying efficiency or the flicker of joy seen in her eyes during battle, her cover story would be to blame it on a "battle madness" or the "divine fury" of her bloodline—an external force possessing her—rather than admit the horrifying truth that it is genuinely a part of her.

## The Cost of the Masks: Alexiel's Relationships

Alexiel's victory at the Starfall Gambit cemented her legend, but it also permanently locked her inside her own fortress of deception. The habit of wearing masks, which she adopted for survival, became an ingrained, inescapable part of her being. She loved her family fiercely, but it was the guarded, protective love of a commander for her troops, not the open, vulnerable love of a wife and mother.

### Her Husband, Artorius (The Perfect Lie)
Her entire relationship with Artorius, the one truly good man in her life, was built on her most convincing performance: the Layer 2 "Reluctant Champion." He fell in love with a tragic, gentle soul who was burdened by a skill for violence she claimed to hate. He never knew the cold, brilliant strategist who planned campaigns in her mind, nor the "Joyful Predator" that thrilled at the perfect execution of a battle plan.

**The Cost**: While she likely felt a genuine, deep affection for him, she could never grant him the vulnerability of seeing her true self. Their intimacy was fundamentally flawed. He could share her bed, but she could never truly share her mind or soul with him. His death was a source of real grief, but it was also, terrifyingly, a release—the pressure of maintaining her most difficult mask was gone, leaving her free to let her strategic mind operate without the constraint of his gentle conscience.

### Her Sons, Cassian & Valerius (Worshipping a Monument)
After Artorius's death, Alexiel retired the "Reluctant Champion" mask. For her sons, she crafted a new one, a fusion of her public persona and her inner coldness: The "God-Warrior" Mask.

**The Persona**: This was a mask of serene, distant, and perfect strength. She was no longer a warm mother, but a living monument to her own legend. Her love was expressed through lessons in swordplay, lectures on strategy, and a relentless demand for perfection. She was their commander, their mentor, but never their confidante.

**How it Shaped Them**:
- Cassian grew up idolizing the "Warrior" aspect of the mask. He saw her physical prowess and sought to emulate it, believing that achieving martial glory was the only way to earn the approval of his distant, legendary mother.
- Valerius grew up idolizing the "God" aspect—her perfect, calm, strategic control. He interpreted her emotional distance as proof that emotion itself was a flaw, a vulnerability to be purged in the pursuit of perfect discipline.

**The Cost**: Both sons spent their lives trying to please a persona, not a person. They never knew their mother, only her legend. This is why her "un-heroic" death at the Betrayer's Bridge shattered them so completely; monuments are not supposed to die because they were worried about their child.

### Her Daughter, Sariel (The Terrifying Mirror)
**The Favourite**: Sariel was her secret favorite. In her daughter's quiet, analytical mind, Alexiel saw a terrifying and undeniable reflection of her own hidden Layer 3 self—the brilliant strategist she kept locked away. This recognition was the source of both her deepest affection and her greatest fear.

**The Dilemma and Deception**: Alexiel knew that to nurture Sariel's intellect would be to potentially raise another monster like herself, a master of deception and cold calculation. To protect Sariel from this path, she kept her at an even greater distance. She could not reveal her true self, because she believed that truth would corrupt her daughter. The "God-Warrior" mask was completely ineffective on Sariel, who had no interest in martial pursuits, creating a relationship defined by a tragic, mutual misunderstanding: Sariel felt she could never live up to her mother's legend, while Alexiel was desperately trying to keep her daughter from becoming just like her.

**The Ultimate Cost**: This inability to be honest and vulnerable with the child she most identified with was her fatal error. By trying to "protect" Sariel from the world's harsh realities and her own dark nature, she left Sariel unprepared and naive. This lack of preparation is what allowed Sariel to be taken hostage at the Betrayer's Bridge, leading directly to Alexiel's death. The final cost of her lifelong deception was her own life.

## The Fall of the Mortal Star - Alexiel's Death

### The Vengeful Son's Trap
In the years leading up to the final battle, Warlord Mordan, son of two of the slain Apostates, meticulously planned his revenge. His agents finally succeeded in kidnapping Sariel. Through light, but persistent, torture, he broke the young scholar and learned the secret to her mother's soul: Alexiel's absolute, unbreakable moral code to protect children. Mordan, himself an elite warrior with a core of disciplined troops, then set his trap. He didn't believe he could beat Alexiel in a fair fight; his goal was to create a scenario where her own morality would force her to destroy herself.

### The Battle of the Sacrifice Fields
Alexiel, after a frantic, weeks-long search, finally located her daughter. She and her elite Starfall Guard found Mordan's army in a remote valley, arrayed around a massive, unholy altar. Upon it, a central mage was preparing a ritual to sacrifice hundreds of recently captured children.

Alexiel was prepared to unleash everything. Her plan was simple and direct: she and her guard would storm the enemy lines, cut through to the central mage, and kill him before the ritual could begin. For the first time, she was prepared to use all three layers of her hidden power—her martial skill, her secret magic, and if necessary, the Nullification Field—to prevent the atrocity.

### The Impossible Choice
The assault was a whirlwind of martial perfection. Alexiel and her guard tore through Mordan's elite warriors, closing in on the central mage. But at the moment she was poised to strike him down, Mordan played his final card. He emerged from a command tent, dragging a bound Sariel with him. Before Alexiel's horrified eyes, he drew a blade and sliced off Sariel's ear, holding it up to show he was serious.

Sariel's terrified, pain-filled scream for her mother shattered Alexiel's perfect strategic calm. In that instant, her Layer 3 (The Joyful Predator) mind, the cold strategist, was overwhelmed by a mother's primal rage. She abandoned her primary objective—the mage—and launched herself at Mordan.

### The Hollow Victory
The fight was brutally short. Enraged and focused on a single target, Alexiel was an unstoppable force of nature. She easily killed Mordan and his personal guard, cutting them down before they could further harm her daughter. But as she scooped up her bleeding, weeping child, a wave of horrific green energy pulsed from the altar behind them. The ritual had begun. Children began to die. Her personal victory had cost her the strategic one.

### Atonement
Holding her daughter, Alexiel surveyed the horror she had allowed to happen. In a voice filled with a terrible, newfound calm, she gave her final orders. She commanded her remaining Starfall Guard to abandon the fight with Mordan's leaderless army and save as many children from the ritual's spreading corruption as they could.

Then, as Sariel watched in horror, Alexiel unleashed her ultimate power. She poured every ounce of her will and life force into her Nullification Field, expanding it to a massive, unprecedented scale to encompass the entire valley and snuff out the profane magic.

This time, the agony was real. The lie she had maintained her entire life became the truth. The strain of wielding such immense power on that scale was too much for her mortal body. The field held just long enough for the ritual to collapse, but the effort burned her out from the inside. She collapsed, her life force extinguished, dying in the arms of the horrified daughter she had just rescued. Her legend was cemented as a hero who made the ultimate sacrifice, but the truth of her final moments—a mother's fateful, emotional choice—was a secret that would forever haunt her daughter.

By having Sariel present at her mother's final sacrifice, we have now established the pivotal moment in her own story. She no longer needs to find a secondary witness or a forgotten text to learn of her mother's greatest secret. The memory of the Nullification Field—its feeling, its effect, and the sight of her mother's sacrifice—is now burned directly into her own mind. When the time comes for her to achieve her own "profound victory," she will use her Mnemonic Replication to draw upon her own most traumatic memory and manifest her mother's ultimate power.
