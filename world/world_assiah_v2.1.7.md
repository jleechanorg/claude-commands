Name: Zanja of the Broken-Tusk Tribe

Archetype/Role: The Elder Shaman

Occupation/Social Standing: Chief spiritual advisor to War-Chief Vorlag; Keeper of the Old Ways.

Myers-Briggs Type (MBTI): (Internal) INFJ (The Advocate: Mystical and insightful, driven by a deep understanding of the patterns that govern the world.)

II. Psychology & Personality

Greatest Fear: That her people will trade their souls for security, becoming just another hollow empire.
