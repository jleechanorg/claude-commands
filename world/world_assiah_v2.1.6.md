## Tsuran Dominion Characters

### Character Dossier: Daimyo Kenjiro of House Akai
#### Part 1: Personality Profile
I. Core Identity

Name: Kenjiro of House Akai

Archetype/Role: The Founding Father

Occupation/Social Standing: First and ruling Daimyo of the Tsuran Dominion.

D&D Alignment: (Internal) Lawful Neutral (Kenjiro believes that a rigid, honor-bound social structure is the only thing that can prevent society from collapsing into the madness of the Imperium or the chaos of the Host. The law is absolute, and sentiment is a flaw.)

Myers-Briggs Type (MBTI): (Internal) ISTJ (The Logistician: A pillar of strength and duty. He builds his world on facts, tradition, and unwavering adherence to the established order he helped create.)

II. Psychology & Personality

Core Motivation (The "Why"): To ensure the Tsuran Dominion, his life's work, does not fall to the same corruption and genetic decay that destroyed the Imperium he fled. He is driven by a profound fear of repeating the past.

Greatest Fear: That the next generation will forget the reasons for their founding. He is terrified of new ideas and foreign influence, seeing them as the seeds of the same chaos he witnessed in his youth.

Key Personality Traits: Stoic, traditionalist, disciplined, proud, and utterly uncompromising. He has a deep, but rarely shown, well of sorrow for the world he lost.

Quirks & Habits: Spends one hour at dawn every day practicing his swordsmanship with a simple wooden bokken, a ritual he has not missed in fifty years. He often speaks in proverbs and historical allegories.

III. Behavior & Speech

Demeanor Under Stress: He becomes even more rigid and silent. He retreats into protocol and tradition, seeking answers in the established codes of conduct. He will not be rushed and will let a crisis unfold around him while he contemplates the "correct," honorable path.

Speech Patterns: Formal, measured, and archaic. He speaks as if every word will be carved into stone. He is deeply respectful of titles and protocol, and expects the same from others.

Reputation: Within the Dominion, he is a living legend—the father of their nation, revered as a figure of immense wisdom and unshakeable honor. To outsiders, he is seen as a stubborn, xenophobic old man, an obstacle to trade and progress.

IV. Backstory

Defining Moment: As a young legionnaire in the Celestial Imperium, witnessing a high-ranking Empyrean noble succumb to the Empyrean Affliction during a battle, slaughtering his own troops in a fit of paranoid rage. This event shattered Kenjiro's loyalty and convinced him the Imperium was doomed.

Relevant History: Kenjiro was born an Imperial citizen. A gifted soldier, he rose through the ranks of a legion stationed on the eastern continent. After witnessing the madness of the Empyrean Bloodline firsthand, he organized a massive secessionist movement. He led a successful, bloody rebellion that severed the eastern continent from Imperial rule, founding the Tsuran Dominion. He and the other founders deliberately crafted a new culture based on rigid honor, discipline, and a strict caste system, believing it was the only way to create a stable society immune to the decay they had fled.

Secrets: Kenjiro keeps a hidden collection of pre-Rebellion Imperial art and literature. He secretly mourns the beauty and culture that were lost to the madness, a sentiment he would consider a fatal weakness if it were ever discovered by his people.

V. Game Mechanics

Feats: Inspiring Leader, Martial Adept, and a custom "Iaijutsu Master" feat.

Special Abilities / Powers: Though past his prime, he is a master strategist and a legendary duelist. His abilities focus on leadership and single, decisive combat actions rather than prolonged brawls.

VI. Psychological Deep Dive

1 · Rough portrait Kenjiro is a man who built a nation as a fortress against his own memories. He is the embodiment of Tsuran tradition because he wrote the first page of that tradition with the blood of his former comrades. Every law, every ritual, is a stone in the wall he has built to keep out the chaos of his past. He is a great man, a visionary leader, but he is so terrified of the past that he is strangling his nation's future.

2 · Composite psychological sketch | Dimension | Reading | Personal twist | |---|---|---| | Big Five | [O: 1, C: 5, E: 2, A: 2, N: 1] | His near-zero Openness makes him hostile to any change to the system he built. His maximum Conscientiousness is the driving force behind his discipline and the nation's stability. His extremely low Neuroticism gives him an aura of unshakable calm and authority. | | Dominant defenses | Reaction Formation, Isolation of Affect | The entire Tsuran culture is a reaction formation against the chaos of the Imperium. He isolates his personal feelings of grief for the world he lost, focusing instead on the emotionless application of law and tradition. | | Attachment color | Dismissive-Avoidant | He holds himself apart from personal relationships, interacting with others based on their rank and function within the system. He sees emotional bonds as a potential weakness. |

3 · Social persona vs. repressed interior

Social persona: The Wise Daimyo. A stoic, honorable, and unshakeable leader who is the living embodiment of Tsuran values.

Inner person: A deeply tired man who carries the immense weight of his violent past. He is perpetually vigilant, seeing the potential for corruption and decay in every shadow.

4 · Defense-mechanism diagnostics | Mechanism | Everyday illustration | |---|---| | Reaction Formation | His obsession with rigid social protocol is a direct counter to the impulsive, emotional volatility he witnessed among the Empyrean nobles. | | Isolation of Affect | He can sentence a subordinate to death for a breach of honor and show absolutely no emotion, discussing it only in terms of its necessity to maintain the integrity of the code. | | Intellectualization | He doesn't speak of his rebellion as a messy, bloody war, but as a "necessary geopolitical realignment to correct a systemic structural failure." |

5 · Relational decoding

Attachment script: ["If I deviate from the code, then chaos will return and destroy everything I have built."]

He judges everyone, including himself, by their adherence to the law. There are no exceptions.

He cannot be persuaded by appeals to emotion, only by arguments rooted in tradition and honor.

6 · Core unconscious beliefs

A perfect system can make imperfect people strong.

The past is a predator that must be kept caged.

There is no middle ground between order and annihilation.

7 · Personal myth narrative

Role: The Lawgiver

Story told: ["I looked upon chaos and madness, and from it, I forged a nation of perfect, unbreakable order."]

Comfort: The flawless execution of a state ceremony or ritual. The quiet contemplation of his rock garden.

Toxicity: His myth makes him incapable of adaptation. He cannot see that the rigid system designed to protect his people is now stifling their growth and making them vulnerable to new kinds of threats.

8 · Break-point scenario

Catalyst: Undeniable proof that the rigid code he created is directly causing a great tragedy or creating a new form of corruption that mirrors the one he fled. For instance, a loyal subordinate following the code perfectly leads to the death of hundreds.

What fractures: His core belief that his system is perfect and that it is the only shield against chaos.

Immediate cost: A rare, terrifying display of rage, followed by a period of deep, silent withdrawal as he is forced to confront the failure of his life's work.

Liberation: Would allow him to finally trust the spirit of the law over the letter, and to empower the next generation (like Asami) to adapt the Dominion for a new age.

9 · Closing pulse He built a perfect cage to keep the monsters out, and never realized he had locked his people inside with him.

### Character Dossier: Lady Asami of House Yukimura
#### Part 1: Personality Profile
I. Core Identity

Name: Asami of House Yukimura

Archetype/Role: The Ambitious Reformer

Occupation/Social Standing: Governor of the Jade Province; Kenjiro's expected successor.

D&D Alignment: (Internal) Lawful Evil (Asami believes in the Tsuran system but is willing to use any means—including manipulation, blackmail, and assassination—to strengthen it. She is not sadistic, but coldly practical.)

Myers-Briggs Type (MBTI): (Internal) ENTJ (The Commander: A natural leader with a sharp mind for strategy. She sees the world as a problem to be solved and is utterly confident in her ability to solve it.)

II. Psychology & Personality

Core Motivation (The "Why"): To elevate the Tsuran Dominion to its rightful place as the preeminent power in the world. She believes this requires modernization and expansion, which puts her at odds with the old guard.

Greatest Fear: That the Dominion will stagnate and be crushed between the dying Imperium and the rising powers of the world. She fears irrelevance through inaction.

Key Personality Traits: Ambitious, brilliant, ruthlessly pragmatic, charismatic (in a cold way), and possesses a genuine, if twisted, love for her nation.

Quirks & Habits: She practices the tea ceremony daily but always has her bodyguard taste it first. She collects intelligence on everyone she meets and maintains meticulous files on potential allies and enemies.

III. Behavior & Speech

Demeanor Under Stress: She becomes sharper and more focused. Stress clarifies her thinking. She will make rapid, decisive moves and expects absolute obedience from her subordinates in implementing them.

Speech Patterns: Polite, formal, and laden with double meanings. She can deliver a death threat while discussing the weather, all while maintaining perfect courtesy.

Reputation: Within the Dominion, she is seen as the future—brilliant, ambitious, perhaps too modern. Her enemies call her "The Jade Serpent." Outsiders see her as the most reasonable and approachable of the Tsuran leadership, not realizing this makes her the most dangerous.

IV. Backstory

Defining Moment: At age sixteen, discovering that her beloved mentor was planning to betray the Dominion to the Imperium for personal gain. She exposed him, leading to his execution, but not before learning all his methods of espionage and manipulation.

Relevant History: Asami is third-generation Tsuran, raised entirely within the Dominion's rigid system. Unlike Kenjiro, she has no memory of the Imperium and thus no fear of it. She rose through the administrative ranks through a combination of genuine brilliance and the strategic elimination of rivals. She modernized the Jade Province, making it the Dominion's economic powerhouse, which brought her to Kenjiro's attention as a potential successor. She walks a careful line between honoring the old ways and pushing for necessary change.

Secrets: Asami has established secret trade relationships with several Nexus Merchant Princes, importing forbidden gnomish technology in exchange for Tsuran steel. She believes technological superiority, not just honor, will secure the Dominion's future.

V. Game Mechanics

Feats: Keen Mind, Alert, Poisoner.

Special Abilities / Powers: A master spy and administrator. Her abilities focus on gathering intelligence, manipulating social situations, and efficiently managing resources.

VI. Psychological Deep Dive

1 · Rough portrait Asami is what happens when you raise a genius within a system of absolute law and order. She has internalized the Dominion's values so completely that she can betray its traditions in service of its survival without feeling any contradiction. She is a patriot who would burn half her nation to save the other half, and she would sleep soundly knowing she made the optimal choice.

2 · Composite psychological sketch | Dimension | Reading | Personal twist | |---|---|---| | Big Five | [O: 4, C: 5, E: 4, A: 1, N: 2] | Her high Openness allows her to see beyond tradition to new possibilities. Her extremely low Agreeableness means she has no compunction about using others as tools. Her high Conscientiousness drives her meticulous planning and flawless execution. | | Dominant defenses | Rationalization, Intellectualization | She can rationalize any action, no matter how brutal, as being for the greater good of the Dominion. She intellectualizes human relationships into strategic assets and liabilities. | | Attachment color | Dismissive (Strategic) | She forms alliances, not friendships. Even her loyalty to the Dominion is based on a calculated assessment of its value and potential, not emotional attachment. |

3 · Social persona vs. repressed interior

Social persona: The Perfect Tsuran Lady. Honorable, dutiful, and gracefully lethal.

Inner person: A chess player who sees the world as a board and people as pieces. She has a cold, vast ambition that would terrify even her allies if they truly understood it.

4 · Defense-mechanism diagnostics | Mechanism | Everyday illustration | |---|---| | Rationalization | "The merchant's family had to die as well. Leaving witnesses would have created instability in the trade routes, ultimately harming thousands of Tsuran citizens." | | Intellectualization | She doesn't see a rival's fear as they're led to execution; she sees "the successful conclusion of a two-year influence operation." | | Sublimation | She channels her ruthless nature into "patriotic service," turning what might be sociopathic tendencies into statecraft. |

5 · Relational decoding

Attachment script: ["If you are useful to the Dominion's glory, then you have value. If not, you are an obstacle to be removed."]

She grants favor based entirely on a person's strategic value.

She is incapable of true trust, maintaining multiple contingency plans for every alliance.

6 · Core unconscious beliefs

Sentiment is the enemy of efficiency.

The Dominion is more important than any individual, including myself.

Power unused is power wasted.

7 · Personal myth narrative

Role: The Architect of Empire

Story told: ["The old ways built our foundation, but I will build our future, no matter the cost."]

Comfort: The successful completion of a complex political scheme. Reviewing economic reports showing the Dominion's growth.

Toxicity: Her myth makes her incapable of seeing value in anything that doesn't serve her vision of the Dominion's future. She would sacrifice genuine human progress for geopolitical advantage.

8 · Break-point scenario

Catalyst: Being presented with irrefutable evidence that her modernization efforts are destroying the very cultural essence that makes the Dominion worth saving. That in trying to save her nation, she is killing its soul.

What fractures: Her core belief that she knows what is best for the Dominion.

Immediate cost: A moment of paralyzing doubt, followed by an even more ruthless purge of the "weak" elements she blames for the failure.

Liberation: Could potentially lead her to find a balance between preservation and progress, though it's more likely to simply make her more sophisticated in her tyranny.

9 · Closing pulse She would forge a golden age for her people from their own bones if necessary.

### Character Dossier: The Ghost of the Tenth Legion
#### Part 1: Personality Profile
I. Core Identity

Name: Unknown (uses various aliases, most commonly "Jin")

Archetype/Role: The Faceless Blade

Occupation/Social Standing: Master assassin and intelligence operative of the Dominion's "Tenth Legion" (which officially doesn't exist).

D&D Alignment: (Internal) True Neutral (The Ghost has no personal ideology beyond the mission. They are a tool that points wherever their handler aims them.)

Myers-Briggs Type (MBTI): (Internal) ISTP (The Virtuoso: A master of tools and techniques. For the Ghost, killing is simply a technical skill perfected through practice.)

II. Psychology & Personality

Core Motivation (The "Why"): Unknown, even to themselves. They have been so thoroughly conditioned that personal desires have been erased. They exist only to serve the Dominion through perfect execution of their missions.

Greatest Fear: Identity. The idea of being a person with wants, needs, and connections terrifies them more than death.

Key Personality Traits: Silent, methodical, adaptable, emotionally vacant, and utterly professional.

Quirks & Habits: Never sits with their back to a door. Constantly changes their appearance in subtle ways. Has a collection of masks but never shows their true face, even when alone.

III. Behavior & Speech

Demeanor Under Stress: No change. The Ghost treats a casual conversation and a life-or-death battle with the same detached professionalism.

Speech Patterns: When they must speak, they use whatever voice and mannerisms best suit their current cover identity. Their "true" voice, if it exists, has never been heard.

Reputation: Most believe the "Ghost of the Tenth Legion" is a myth, a boogeyman used to scare Tsuran enemies. Those few who know the truth never speak of it.

IV. Backstory

Defining Moment: There isn't one. Their past was deliberately erased through a combination of drugs, conditioning, and magical manipulation. They literally cannot remember who they were before becoming the Ghost.

Relevant History: The Tenth Legion is the Dominion's most closely guarded secret—a program that takes orphans and transforms them into perfect assassins through brutal training and systematic destruction of identity. The Ghost is the program's greatest success, a person reduced to a living weapon. They have carried out dozens of impossible assassinations, destabilized enemy governments, and eliminated threats to the Dominion without leaving a trace. Lady Asami is one of the few who knows how to contact them.

Secrets: Deep beneath the conditioning, fragments of memory sometimes surface in dreams—a woman singing, the taste of persimmons, the weight of a farming tool in small hands. The Ghost ruthlessly suppresses these fragments, fearing that remembering who they were might compromise what they are.

V. Game Mechanics

Feats: Skulker, Mobile, Observant.

Special Abilities / Powers: Master of disguise, infiltration, and assassination. Can adopt any identity, speak any language fluently, and kill in a hundred different ways.

VI. Psychological Deep Dive

1 · Rough portrait The Ghost is the logical endpoint of the Tsuran system taken to its absolute extreme—a person who has sacrificed everything, including their very self, in service to the state. They are simultaneously the Dominion's greatest weapon and its most tragic victim, a hollow shell that performs perfect violence because it has nothing else left.

2 · Composite psychological sketch | Dimension | Reading | Personal twist | |---|---|---| | Big Five | [O: 3, C: 5, E: 1, A: 2, N: 1] | Their extreme scores reflect their conditioning. Maximum Conscientiousness for mission perfection. Minimum Extraversion and Neuroticism create a person who neither seeks interaction nor feels stress. Moderate Openness allows for tactical adaptability. | | Dominant defenses | Depersonalization, Dissociation | They have completely depersonalized themselves, viewing their body as a tool. They dissociate from any emotional content, observing their actions as if from outside themselves. | | Attachment color | None (Absent) | They are incapable of forming attachments. People are either targets, assets, or irrelevant background noise. |

3 · Social persona vs. repressed interior

Social persona: Whatever the mission requires. They have a library of false identities but no true self.

Inner person: An empty room with fragments of memory scattered like broken glass on the floor, too dangerous to touch.

4 · Defense-mechanism diagnostics | Mechanism | Everyday illustration | |---|---| | Depersonalization | They refer to themselves in mission reports as "the asset" and describe their actions in third person. | | Dissociation | During torture resistance training, they learned to completely separate consciousness from physical sensation, watching their body endure pain without feeling it. | | Suppression | When a memory fragment surfaces—like the woman singing—they immediately engage in complex mental exercises to push it back down. |

5 · Relational decoding

Attachment script: [ERROR: No attachment script found. Subject incapable of relational bonding.]

6 · Core unconscious beliefs

I am the mission.

Memory is weakness.

To be no one is to be perfect.

7 · Personal myth narrative

Role: The Empty Vessel

Story told: ["There was someone before, but they were weak. I am what remains when all weakness is burned away."]

Comfort: The moment of a perfect kill. The successful completion of a mission without leaving any trace of identity.

Toxicity: Their myth has destroyed their humanity. They are a tragedy wearing the mask of a success story.

8 · Break-point scenario

Catalyst: A mission that forces them to protect rather than kill someone who triggers those memory fragments—perhaps a child who sings the same song as the forgotten woman.

What fractures: The wall between their conditioned identity and their erased past.

Immediate cost: Complete operational paralysis. They would be unable to function as either the Ghost or whoever they were before.

Liberation: The possibility of recovering their identity and becoming a person again, though the journey would be agonizing and might destroy them entirely.

9 · Closing pulse They are a person who committed suicide in every way except the physical, leaving only a shadow to serve.

## The Starfall Gambit: Complete Details

The Starfall Gambit was the decisive battle that ended the Unchained Host's rebellion, where Alexiel's thirty elite guards gave their lives to help her defeat Lucifer and his Seven Apostates.

### Why "Starfall"?

The name has multiple layered meanings:

1. **The Fall of a "Constellation" of Leaders**: The single battle resulted in the deaths of the most powerful and famous figures—the "stars"—of the entire age. Lucifer and his six top generals (the seven apostates) were all extinguished in one night, as were the 30 elite champions of Alexiel's Guard. It was as if an entire constellation of the world's most prominent figures fell from the sky at once.

2. **Alexiel, the "Mortal Star"**: Alexiel's entire career was like that of a brilliant, fast-burning star rising to rival the gods. The gambit was her final, most dazzling act. In the mythology of the event, she is depicted as a single star streaking down from the heavens to sacrifice itself to extinguish the great darkness of Lucifer and his generals. The name immortalizes her as the "star that fell."

3. **The Visuals of the Assault**: The battle took place at Lucifer's fortress, the Obsidian Spire, a tall, dark tower. Alexiel and her 30 warriors of the Starfall Guard, clad in shining armor, launched a surprise assault from a secret upper entrance. To any distant observers, the sight of these elite, light-wreathed warriors descending upon the dark spire would have looked like a shower of falling stars, culminating in a massive explosion of power at its peak.

## The Unseeing Eyes

### Description
A Null's eyes are marked by irises that are shot through with a network of fine, silvery-white lines, resembling cracked porcelain or frosted glass. This gives their gaze a strange, unfocused, and distant quality, as if they are looking at the world through a shattered veil. It is the physical manifestation of their severed connection to the flow of magical energy.

## Key Name Changes and Canon Details

### Confirmed Canon Elements:
- The antagonist Kraven is now named **Mordan** (and he is canonically dead)
- Lucifer's generals, the Seven Scourges, are now **The Seven Apostates**
- Alexiel's elite unit is now **The Starfall Guard**
- Sariel's companions are **Ser Gideon Vance** and **Lady Cressida Valeriana**

### Sariel's True Nature: The Path of the Mirror Mage
Sariel's journey is not one of a non-magical person discovering power, but of a magical prodigy breaking through the emotional and psychological cages that have stifled her immense, inherited talent.

#### Layer 1: The Inept Mage (The Public Mask)
**The Persona**: To the Imperial court and the world, Sariel is not a Null, but something almost more pitiable: a magically-active Empyrean of the purest blood who is utterly incompetent. When she is compelled to try, her attempts at even the simplest spells are clumsy, weak, or fail spectacularly. This is a deliberate performance; she fakes her ineptitude to reinforce her reputation as a harmless, broken scholar, ensuring no one ever considers her a magical threat or talent worth cultivating.

#### Layer 2: The Unfolding Prodigy (The Inner Circle's Secret)
**The Reality**: Her companions—Gideon, Cressida, and Rowan—know the truth. They have seen flashes of her true potential in private moments of desperation or focus. They understand that she is not weak, but a "late bloomer" whose power is psychologically blocked by her immense guilt and the crushing weight of her family's legacy. Her journey with them is one of slowly learning to control this power, with their support acting as the catalyst for her growth.

#### Layer 3: The Perfect Mirror (Her True, Legendary Power)
**The Hidden Power**: As a late bloomer, Sariel has manifested a legendary and unique magical art: Mirror Magic. This ability allows her to perfectly replicate magical energies she observes, bypassing the years of study most mages require. It has three distinct functions:
- **Visual Replication**: She can perfectly copy and cast a spell immediately after seeing it performed.
- **Textual Replication**: She can look at a magical scroll or open a spellbook and instantly understand and cast the spell from the text, without the need for lengthy research or transcription.
- **Mnemonic Replication**: Her most profound and dangerous ability. She can touch a person and read their memories, allowing her to find and perfectly copy a spell that person has either cast or witnessed.

### The Culmination of Her Arc
Sariel's story will be about her overcoming her self-doubt to master this incredible power. The climax of her journey will be when she finally finds the catatonic survivor of the Starfall Guard. Using her Mnemonic Replication, she will delve into his shattered memories and witness the true story of her mother's final battle, allowing her to copy the legendary Nullification Field.

In a moment of profound victory, she will use her mother's own hidden weapon—a power she has only ever seen in a memory—to save the Imperium, finally stepping out of her mother's shadow by becoming her perfect, terrifying mirror.
