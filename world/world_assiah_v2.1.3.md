## First-Spear Clans Characters

### Character Dossier: War-Chief Vorlag
#### Part 1: Personality Profile
I. Core Identity

Name: Vorlag, son of Kor'gath (the first War-Chief)

Archetype/Role: The Burdened Leader

Occupation/Social Standing: High War-Chief of the First-Spear Clans coalition.

D&D Alignment: (Internal) Lawful Neutral (Vorlag believes that for his people to survive, they must evolve from a horde of rebels into a disciplined, stable nation with laws and alliances, even if it means compromising their warrior traditions.)

Myers-Briggs Type (MBTI): (Internal) ESTJ (The Executive: An excellent administrator and unparalleled at managing things or people. He is driven by a sense of duty and tradition, and believes in doing things the "right" way.)

II. Psychology & Personality

Core Motivation (The "Why"): To ensure his father's sacrifice was not in vain. He is driven to build a nation that is not only strong enough to defy the Imperium but also stable enough to last for generations.

Greatest Fear: That his people's own warlike nature will be their undoing. He is terrified that a premature war, provoked by hot-heads like Karg, will lead to their annihilation and prove the Imperium's rhetoric that they are nothing but savages.

Key Personality Traits: Pragmatic, patient, determined, deeply weary, and possesses a strong sense of duty.

Quirks & Habits: He carries his father's chipped axe, but uses a finely crafted warhammer in battle, symbolizing his struggle between honoring the past and building the future. He often rubs the haft of the axe when deep in thought.

III. Behavior & Speech

Demeanor Under Stress: He becomes stoic and stubborn. He listens to all counsel but is slow to make a decision, weighing every consequence. He will absorb insults and challenges with a stony silence, refusing to be baited into a rash action.

Speech Patterns: His voice is a deep, gravelly rumble. He speaks slowly and deliberately, choosing his words with care. He is not a charismatic orator but commands respect through his quiet confidence and unshakeable resolve.

Reputation: He is respected by most of the clan elders as a wise and necessary leader. The younger warriors, however, are growing restless under his cautious leadership, seeing his diplomacy as weakness. The Imperium sees him as a credible and rational threat, unlike the savage warlords of the Shattered Host.

IV. Backstory

Defining Moment: Witnessing his father, the hero of the Uprising of the First-Spear, die not in a glorious battle, but from a festering wound taken in a minor skirmish that could have been avoided. This taught him that pointless bravado leads only to death and that a true leader's duty is to preserve his people's strength, not just spend it.

Relevant History: Vorlag grew up in the shadow of his legendary father, Kor'gath. He was raised in the brutal, chaotic early days of the Clans, a constant war for survival. Upon his father's death, Vorlag inherited leadership and made a controversial choice: instead of continuing the endless war, he began to forge the loose coalition of tribes into a true nation, establishing laws, trade routes, and a code of conduct. This has been his life's work, a constant, exhausting struggle against both outside threats and the internal pressures of his own people's warrior culture.

Secrets: Vorlag has opened a secret, back-channel line of communication with a reformist faction within the Tsuran Dominion. He believes an alliance with another independent power is their only long-term hope for survival against the Imperium, but he knows his people would see any dealings with another human nation as a betrayal.

V. Game Mechanics

Feats: Inspiring Leader, Shield Master, Sentinel.

Special Abilities / Powers: A master of defensive combat and battlefield command. His techniques focus on controlling the flow of battle and protecting his allies, rather than pure personal glory.

VI. Psychological Deep Dive

1 · Rough portrait Vorlag is a man trying to build a stone fortress on the back of a storm. He carries the weight of his father's legacy and the future of his people on his broad shoulders. Every decision is a careful calculation, balancing the fierce pride that freed his people with the pragmatism needed to keep them from being annihilated. He is a king who remembers being a slave, and that memory is the source of both his strength and his immense weariness.

2 · Composite psychological sketch | Dimension | Reading | Personal twist | |---|---|---| | Big Five | [O: 2, C: 5, E: 3, A: 3, N: 2] | His high Conscientiousness drives his nation-building and sense of duty. His low Openness makes him skeptical of new, radical ideas from his own people, but his pragmatism allows him to consider outside alliances. His low Neuroticism gives him a calm, steady demeanor. | | Dominant defenses | Altruism, Suppression | He manages his personal anxieties and grief by focusing entirely on the needs of his people (Altruism). He actively suppresses his own warrior instincts and desire for glory in favor of what he believes is the more responsible path of diplomacy and defense. | | Attachment color | Secure | Vorlag forms strong, stable relationships built on mutual respect and proven loyalty. He trusts his advisors (like Zanja) implicitly and values their counsel, even when it is difficult to hear. |

3 · Social persona vs. repressed interior

Social persona: The wise and steady War-Chief. A patient, unshakable leader who is the bedrock of the First-Spear Nation.

Inner person: A deeply tired warrior who longs for the simplicity of battle but is shackled by the immense responsibility of leadership. He constantly doubts whether he is living up to his father's heroic legacy.

4 · Defense-mechanism diagnostics | Mechanism | Everyday illustration | |---|---|---| | Altruism | He will forgo his own rations to ensure a supply line reaches a struggling border settlement, finding personal satisfaction in their well-being. | | Suppression | When Karg insults his honor publicly, Vorlag will consciously push down his own rage, refusing to engage in a duel he knows would destabilize the clans, even though every instinct screams for him to fight. | | Anticipation | He spends countless hours planning for worst-case scenarios—failed harvests, surprise Imperial attacks, internal rebellions—using anxiety about the future as fuel for meticulous preparation. |

5 · Relational decoding

Attachment script: ["If I demonstrate reliability and protect my people, then they will grant me their loyalty."]

He builds alliances slowly, through actions and proven support, rather than charismatic speeches.

He judges others not by their words or strength, but by their reliability and commitment to their people.

6 · Core unconscious beliefs

A nation is built with granaries, not just axes.

Uncontrolled pride is the sharpest poison.

My father won the war; my job is not to lose the peace.

7 · Personal myth narrative

Role: The Weary Builder

Story told: ["My father was the fire that broke our chains; I must be the stone that builds our home."]

Comfort: Reviewing grain silo reports and troop readiness charts. The quiet, predictable work of running a nation brings him a sense of control.

Toxicity: His caution and focus on stability can cause him to miss fleeting opportunities for bold, decisive action that could secure a greater victory for his people. He can be overly bureaucratic.

8 · Break-point scenario

Catalyst: His diplomatic efforts lead to a catastrophic betrayal. An alliance he carefully forged (like the secret one with the Tsuran) turns on him, leading to a devastating defeat that his people blame on his "weakness."

What fractures: His core belief that pragmatism and order are superior to the warrior's path.

Immediate cost: A deep depression and a crisis of faith in his own leadership. He might abdicate his position, believing his way has failed, or revert to the ruthless warrior he once was.

Liberation: Would teach him that true leadership requires a balance of both diplomacy and strength, and that sometimes, the warrior's path is the correct one.

9 · Closing pulse He is trying to teach a wolf to be a sheepdog, and is never sure if he's taming it or breaking its spirit.

### Character Dossier: Zanja, the First Shaman
#### Part 1: Personality Profile
I. Core Identity

Name: Zanja

Archetype/Role: The Primal Oracle

Occupation/Social Standing: First Shaman of the First-Spear Clans; Chief Advisor to Vorlag; Keeper of Histories.

D&D Alignment: (Internal) True Neutral (Zanja's loyalty is not to a nation or a person, but to the health of the world's elemental spirits. She sees the Imperium and the Host as equal blights upon the natural order.)

Myers-Briggs Type (MBTI): (Internal) INFJ (The Advocate: With a deep sense of idealism and morality, she uses her insight not to lead, but to guide and counsel, seeing the interconnectedness of all things.)

II. Psychology & Personality

Core Motivation (The "Why"): To heal the world from the wounds inflicted by the "unnatural" wars of gods and mortals. She seeks to restore the balance between the physical and spiritual realms.

Greatest Fear: That the "silent sky" left by the Great Vanishing is not an absence, but a sign of a new, far worse power growing in the void between worlds.

Key Personality Traits: Serene, patient, empathetic, mysterious, and possesses an ancient, often unnerving wisdom.

Quirks & Habits: She is constantly carving small, intricate wooden totems of animal spirits. Her eyes, a milky white, seem to look through the physical world into the one beyond. She often answers questions with another, more insightful question.

III. Behavior & Speech

Demeanor Under Stress: She becomes even more still, entering a meditative trance to commune with the spirits for guidance. She is a rock of tranquility in the heart of any storm, her calmness often unnerving those around her.

Speech Patterns: Her voice is a dry, rasping whisper, like autumn leaves skittering on stone. She speaks in parables, metaphors, and prophecies, rarely giving a direct answer.

Reputation: Zanja is the most respected being in the First-Spear Clans. Even the most aggressive warriors like Karg quiet down in her presence. She is seen as a living connection to their people's soul and the wisdom of the world itself.

IV. Backstory

Defining Moment: As a young shaman, she communed with a powerful earth elemental that had been chained and tormented by the Imperium for a thousand years. Experiencing its millennia of pain in a single moment gave her a profound understanding of the true cost of the Seraphim's "order."

Relevant History: Zanja is ancient, one of the few Goblins old enough to remember the final days of the Thousand Year War and the chaos of the Great Vanishing. She was a slave in the Imperial mines, secretly keeping the old shamanistic traditions alive. During the March of Broken Chains, she was freed by Lucifer's forces and quickly became the spiritual heart of the new rebellion, guiding the first War-Chief, Kor'gath. She has been the advisor to the High War-Chief ever since, a constant source of wisdom and a guardian of her people's soul.

Secrets: Zanja knows that the pact Griselda the Carrion Queen made was with a fragment of a bound Primordial. She has not revealed this, as she fears that attempting to stop Griselda might fully awaken the ancient and far more dangerous entity.

V. Game Mechanics

Feats: Ritual Caster, Elemental Adept, Healer.

Special Abilities / Powers: A powerful shaman who can command the elements, speak with spirits, and see glimpses of the future. Her magic is primal and not based on the arcane theories of the Imperium.

VI. Psychological Deep Dive

1 · Rough portrait Zanja is the memory of the world itself, given voice. She is ancient beyond measure, a creature of earth and spirit who has watched empires rise and fall like the seasons. She guides the First-Spear Clans not for their own sake, but because she sees in their primal connection to the world a faint hope for healing the wounds inflicted by the gods. She is a well of immense patience and wisdom, but also of a deep, sorrowful weariness.

2 · Composite psychological sketch | Dimension | Reading | Personal twist | |---|---|---| | Big Five | [O: 4, C: 3, E: 1, A: 4, N: 1] | Her high Openness and Agreeableness make her empathetic and wise. Her extremely low Extraversion makes her a hermit and oracle, not a public leader. Her near-zero Neuroticism gives her an aura of deep, unshakable serenity. | | Dominant defenses | Spiritualization, Altruism | She reframes all worldly suffering and political struggle in a larger, spiritual context, finding meaning in it. She devotes her entire existence to serving the spirits and guiding her people, leaving no room for personal needs or desires. | | Attachment color | Secure (Universal) | Her attachment is not to individuals, but to the world-spirit itself. This allows her to give wise and unbiased counsel, as she is not swayed by personal loyalties, only by what she perceives as the "correct" path for the world. |

3 · Social persona vs. repressed interior

Social persona: The wise old crone. A mysterious, revered, and slightly frightening shaman who speaks with the authority of the gods.

Inner person: A being burdened by visions of what is, what was, and what could be. She carries the pain of the spirits she communes with and is deeply lonely in her unique perspective.

4 · Defense-mechanism diagnostics | Mechanism | Everyday illustration | |---|---|---| | Spiritualization | When a warrior dies, she does not mourn them but says, "His spirit has returned to the earth to give it strength," finding a cosmic purpose in the tragedy. | | Altruism | She will spend days in a painful trance to help heal a blighted patch of land, taking the land's pain into herself. | | Foresight | She avoids making direct decisions by offering cryptic warnings about the future, forcing others to interpret her meaning and bear the responsibility of the choice. |

5 · Relational decoding

Attachment script: ["If I listen to the spirits of the world, then I will know the true path."]

She gives advice that is often frustratingly indirect but always proves to be wise in hindsight.

She trusts those who show respect for the natural world and is deeply suspicious of those who seek to exploit it (like Imperial mages or Gnomish tinkers).

6 · Core unconscious beliefs

The mortal world is just a reflection of the spirit world.

Balance is the only state worth achieving.

The greatest wounds are invisible.

7 · Personal myth narrative

Role: The Keeper of the Balance

Story told: ["The gods broke the world; it is the task of the small to mend it."]

Comfort: Meditating in a place of strong natural power, like an ancient grove or a storm-swept mountaintop.

Toxicity: Her focus on the "great balance" can make her seem detached from the immediate suffering of individuals. She might allow a smaller tragedy to occur to prevent a larger one.

8 · Break-point scenario

Catalyst: A situation where the spirits she trusts give her two directly contradictory prophecies, both of which are coming true. A paradox that proves her spiritual guidance is not infallible.

What fractures: Her core belief that the spirits are the source of ultimate truth and that she can trust her visions.

Immediate cost: A crisis of faith. She would isolate herself completely, refusing to offer any counsel, believing her senses have betrayed her and she is now a danger to her people.

Liberation: Would force her to develop her own innate wisdom, integrating the spirits' counsel with her own long experience to become a truly independent sage.

9 · Closing pulse She is the anchor that keeps her people's ship from being swept away by the storms of their own fury.

### Character Dossier: Karg, the Iron-Tusk
#### Part 1: Personality Profile
I. Core Identity

Name: Karg of the Iron-Tusk Clan

Archetype/Role: The Warrior-Prince

Occupation/Social Standing: Champion of the First-Spear Clans; Leader of the hawkish youth faction.

D&D Alignment: (Internal) Chaotic Neutral (Karg believes in the strength and glory of his people, but he is fundamentally driven by his own ambition and desire for personal glory. He chafes under any law or leader that restricts him.)

Myers-Briggs Type (MBTI): (Internal) ESFP (The Entertainer: Spontaneous, energetic, and enthusiastic people. A warlike version of this type is a charismatic champion who loves the "performance" of battle and the adoration of the crowd.)

II. Psychology & Personality

Core Motivation (The "Why"): To achieve personal glory and prove that the "old ways" of the warrior are the only path to true strength and respect for his people.

Greatest Fear: Being seen as weak or cowardly. He is terrified of a peaceful death, believing a warrior must die in glorious battle.

Key Personality Traits: Charismatic, ambitious, reckless, proud, and possesses an infectious love for battle.

Quirks & Habits: Files the tusks that protrude from his helmet to sharp points before every battle. He laughs loudly during combat. He tells exaggerated stories of his own exploits around the campfire.

III. Behavior & Speech

Demeanor Under Stress: He seeks immediate, physical confrontation. He sees diplomacy as a form of prevarication and will try to force any tense situation into a simple contest of strength.

Speech Patterns: Loud, boastful, and full of charismatic energy. He is a natural orator who can whip young warriors into a frenzy with promises of glory, loot, and vengeance against the Imperium.

Reputation: He is a superstar to the younger generation of warriors, who see him as the true heir to the spirit of the rebellion. Vorlag and the clan elders see him as a dangerous and destabilizing force, a disaster waiting to happen.

IV. Backstory

Defining Moment: Winning the Great Tournament of the Clans at a young age by defeating a champion twice his size through sheer ferocity and will. The roar of the crowd and the glory of that moment became the driving force of his life.

Relevant History: Karg was born after the founding of the Clans. He never knew slavery; he has only known the stories. He grew up in a culture that revered the warriors of the rebellion, and he dedicated his life to becoming the greatest of them all. He sees Vorlag's attempts at nation-building as a betrayal of their warrior heritage. He believes that by constantly raiding and warring with the Imperium, he is keeping the soul of his people alive and strong.

Secrets: Despite his immense strength, Karg is terrified of Zanja's quiet wisdom. Her prophecies unnerve him, and he secretly fears that she is right about his path leading to ruin. He masks this fear with loud disrespect for the shaman.

V. Game Mechanics

Feats: Great Weapon Master, Savage Attacker, Charger.

Special Abilities / Powers: A pure berserker-style warrior. His abilities are all focused on dealing maximum damage and being an unstoppable force on the battlefield.

VI. Psychological Deep Dive

1 · Rough portrait Karg is the glorious, roaring fire of the First-Spear Clans' spirit. He is everything their culture outwardly glorifies: strong, fearless, and hungry for battle. He is a hero born from heroic tales, and he is trying to live up to a legend that may no longer be sustainable. He is the necessary passion of his people, but he is also the reckless ambition that could lead them to ruin.

2 · Composite psychological sketch | Dimension | Reading | Personal twist | |---|---|---| | Big Five | [O: 3, C: 1, E: 5, A: 2, N: 3] | His extremely high Extraversion makes him a charismatic and attention-seeking leader. His extremely low Conscientiousness manifests as a total lack of planning and a reckless disregard for consequences. | | Dominant defenses | Action as Defense, Fantasy | He defends against any feeling of inadequacy or fear by taking immediate, reckless action (Action as Defense). He lives in a fantasy of glorious battle and heroic deeds, ignoring the mundane realities of logistics and politics. | | Attachment color | Secure (Superficial) | He forms bonds easily but they are often superficial, based on shared glory in battle. He is loyal to his war-band but struggles to form deep, individual connections. |

3 · Social persona vs. repressed interior

Social persona: The People's Champion. A laughing, fearless warrior who embodies the heart and soul of the Clans.

Inner person: A young man terrified of not living up to the legends he was raised on. His boastfulness is a shield for his insecurity and his deep-seated fear that peace will render him obsolete.

4 · Defense-mechanism diagnostics | Mechanism | Everyday illustration | |---|---|---| | Action as Defense | If faced with a complex political problem, his immediate response is to suggest a raid on a nearby Imperial outpost to "show them our strength." | | Fantasy | He genuinely believes he can lead a small war-band to sack Aeterna itself, ignoring the logistical impossibility of such a feat, because it makes for a better story. | | Devaluation | He devalues Vorlag's diplomatic achievements, calling treaties "coward's paper" and trade "women's work." |

5 · Relational decoding

Attachment script: ["If you are strong enough to stand with me in battle, then you are my brother."]

He judges everyone by their martial prowess and courage.

He is fiercely loyal to the warriors who fight at his side, sharing spoils generously.

6 · Core unconscious beliefs

A life without glory is not a life worth living.

Strength is the only language our enemies understand.

The old ways are the best ways.

7 · Personal myth narrative

Role: The Reborn Hero

Story told: ["Our leaders have grown old and cautious; I am the second coming of the great heroes who freed us!"]

Comfort: The adoration of his warriors after a victory. The thrill of a life-or-death duel.

Toxicity: His myth makes him incapable of seeing the value in anything other than glorious combat, making him a terrible peacetime leader who would bankrupt his nation on endless, pointless wars.

8 · Break-point scenario

Catalyst: Leading his followers into a glorious battle based on his heroic ideals, only to be completely out-maneuvered and defeated by a clever, "cowardly" tactician who refuses to fight him honorably. Witnessing his loyal followers slaughtered due to his own recklessness.

What fractures: His core belief that pure strength and courage are all that matter.

Immediate cost: A deep, silent shame. He would likely go into self-imposed exile, unable to face the families of those who died for his pride.

Liberation: Could force him to learn humility and strategy, potentially transforming him from a reckless champion into a truly great and wise War-Chief.

9 · Closing pulse He is the glorious song of his people's past, and he is playing it so loudly that no one can hear the future approaching.

## Adamant Vault Characters

### Character Dossier: High Lord Borin Stone-Anvil
#### Part 1: Personality Profile
I. Core Identity

Name: Borin of Clan Stone-Anvil

Archetype/Role: The Merchant King

Occupation/Social Standing: High Lord of the Adamant Vault; Patriarch of the wealthiest clan; Chairman of the Iron Bank.

D&D Alignment: (Internal) Lawful Neutral (Borin's morality is the bottom line of a ledger. He believes in the sanctity of contracts and the accumulation of wealth above all. Good, evil, chaos, and order are merely market conditions to be exploited.)

Myers-Briggs Type (MBTI): (Internal) ESTJ (The Executive: He is a pillar of his community, a brilliant organizer of systems and resources. He values tradition and order, especially when that order ensures his vaults remain full.)

II. Psychology & Personality

Core Motivation (The "Why"): The preservation and growth of his clan's wealth, which is inextricably linked to the economic dominance of the Adamant Vault. He seeks to make the world so dependent on dwarven gold that no power would ever dare threaten them again.

Greatest Fear: Defaulting. Not just on a loan, but the idea that the entire system of contracts and debts that underpins his power could collapse. He fears a world where his gold is worthless.

Key Personality Traits: Shrewd, patient, pragmatic, stubborn, and possesses a dry, cynical wit.

Quirks & Habits: Constantly, almost silently, calculates sums on his fingers when listening to proposals. He personally inspects the hallmark on any coin used in his presence. He drinks only the most expensive, aged spirits.

III. Behavior & Speech

Demeanor Under Stress: He becomes even more calculating and risk-averse. He will never make a rash decision, instead calling for more ledgers, more reports, and more analysis. He uses bureaucracy and procedure as a weapon to slow down any crisis until he can find the most profitable angle.

Speech Patterns: His voice is a low, rumbling baritone. He speaks with the simple, direct language of a contract. He wastes no words on flattery, getting straight to the terms, conditions, and interest rates.

Reputation: He is known as the most powerful man you've never heard of. While kings and warlords make noise, Borin quietly signs the notes that fund their armies. He is respected for his immense wealth and feared for his ability to ruin a nation with the stroke of a quill.

IV. Backstory

Defining Moment: During the chaos of the Age of Rebellion, his father took a massive gamble, loaning a huge sum to a rising Imperial general who was crushed by Lucifer's forces. The default nearly ruined their clan. This taught Borin that backing a single side is a fool's game; true power comes from funding both sides and owning the debt, no matter who wins.

Relevant History: Borin inherited a respected but diminished clan and, through decades of ruthless negotiation, shrewd investments, and by playing the Imperium and the various Host factions against each other, he transformed it into the single wealthiest entity in the world. He orchestrated the Dwarven Declaration of Seclusion not as an act of isolationism, but as a brilliant economic move to consolidate their resources and become the world's sole secure lender in an age of chaos.

Secrets: Borin has a secret vault that doesn't contain gold, but blackmail. He holds the debt-ledgers and incriminating contracts of nearly every major noble house in the Imperium and the Tsuran Dominion, and even some of the more organized Host warlords. This is the true source of his power.

V. Game Mechanics

Feats: Silver-Tongued (Custom), Observant, Linguist.

Special Abilities / Powers: While no warrior, he is a master of economic and social manipulation. His abilities would focus on appraisal, detecting lies, and understanding complex social and financial systems.

VI. Psychological Deep Dive

1 · Rough portrait Borin Stone-Anvil sees the world as a single, massive ledger, and his life's work is to ensure every entry balances in his favor. He is a king whose throne is a mountain of gold and whose armies are clauses in a contract. He has no grand vision for a better world; he simply wants to own the one that exists. He is the embodiment of patient, pragmatic, and utterly ruthless capitalism.

2 · Composite psychological sketch | Dimension | Reading | Personal twist | |---|---|---| | Big Five | [O: 1, C: 5, E: 3, A: 1, N: 1] | His extremely low Openness makes him resistant to any venture that can't be quantified on a balance sheet. His maximum Conscientiousness drives his meticulous record-keeping and long-term planning. His extremely low Agreeableness makes him a merciless negotiator. | | Dominant defenses | Intellectualization (Quantification), Control | He avoids the moral implications of his actions by reducing everything to numbers: profit margins, interest rates, risk percentages. He maintains a sense of safety by exerting absolute control over his financial environment. | | Attachment color | Avoidant-Dismissive | He views personal relationships through the lens of assets and liabilities. He loves his clan and his family as one would love a prized possession that brings generational wealth. |

3 · Social persona vs. repressed interior

Social persona: The respectable banker. A stern, reliable, and powerful figure who is the bedrock of the world's economy.

Inner person: A deeply cynical being who believes everyone and everything has a price. He trusts no one and sees all appeals to morality or honor as simple negotiation tactics.

4 · Defense-mechanism diagnostics | Mechanism | Everyday illustration | |---|---|---| | Intellectualization | When a nation he funded loses a war, he feels no sorrow, instead focusing on "calculating asset depreciation and restructuring the debt portfolio of the conquering power." | | Control | He insists on personally verifying the seals on his vaults every single day, not because he fears theft, but because the ritual reinforces his sense of control over his domain. | | Devaluation | He dismisses the glorious charge of a knight or the heroic sacrifice of a soldier as "a poor return on investment." |

5 · Relational decoding

Attachment script: ["If I control the gold, then I control their choices."]

He never gives aid, he only gives loans. Every act of generosity is a calculated investment designed to create future leverage.

He shows respect not to those with titles, but to those who have a history of paying their debts on time.

6 · Core unconscious beliefs

A contract is more sacred than a god.

History is written by the creditors.

Loyalty can be purchased.

7 · Personal myth narrative

Role: The Keeper of the Scales

Story told: ["While madmen and prophets fought over scraps of land, I built the foundation upon which their pathetic kingdoms rest."]

Comfort: The clink of gold coins. The sight of a new, ironclad contract being signed and sealed. The quiet, humming stillness of his deepest vault.

Toxicity: His myth makes him blind to forces that cannot be bought or quantified, like zealous faith, true ideological conviction, or a desire for vengeance that transcends profit.

8 · Break-point scenario

Catalyst: A major power (perhaps a truly fanatical new leader of the Host or a Tsuran zealot) who he has backed makes a decision that is catastrophically unprofitable but ideologically necessary for them, and then completely and utterly defaults on their debt, publicly declaring his gold to be meaningless in the face of their cause.

What fractures: His core belief that everyone is motivated by rational self-interest and that wealth is the ultimate power.

Immediate cost: A rare state of confusion and impotent rage. He would be at a loss, his primary weapon (financial leverage) rendered useless.

Liberation: Could force him to understand and respect other forms of power, and perhaps even to invest in something other than gold, like genuine alliances or the well-being of his people.

9 · Closing pulse He owns the world, but has forgotten what it is worth.

### Character Dossier: Runesmith Helga Silver-Grasp
#### Part 1: Personality Profile
I. Core Identity

Name: Helga of Clan Silver-Grasp

Archetype/Role: The Keeper of Oaths

Occupation/Social Standing: High Runesmith of the Adamant Vault; Keeper of the Great Vault of Khordûm, where all true histories and binding contracts are stored.

D&D Alignment: (Internal) Lawful Neutral (Helga's world is composed of two things: what was written, and what was sworn. The truth of the past is an unchangeable, absolute force. An oath is a metaphysical law. All else is noise.)

Myers-Briggs Type (MBTI): (Internal) ISTJ (The Logistician: She is defined by her integrity, practical logic, and tireless dedication to duty. She is a guardian of traditions and institutions.)

II. Psychology & Personality

Core Motivation (The "Why"): The preservation of truth. She believes that the Imperium's revisionist history is a sickness, and that the only thing that keeps the world sane is an accurate, unblemished record of all past debts, grudges, oaths, and crimes.

Greatest Fear: That a record will be lost or altered. The thought of a binding contract being destroyed or a historical truth being successfully erased is a form of cosmic horror to her.

Key Personality Traits: Stern, meticulous, deeply traditional, stubborn, and possesses a formidable, encyclopedic memory.

Quirks & Habits: Squints at everyone as if checking for forgeries. She can be found tracing the runes on the vault doors with her fingers. She often mutters old legal precedents or historical dates under her breath.

III. Behavior & Speech

Demeanor Under Stress: She becomes even more reliant on precedent and protocol. She will refuse any action until she can consult the relevant historical or legal record. She is an immovable object of bureaucratic and historical certainty.

Speech Patterns: Precise, formal, and filled with citations. She doesn't just state a fact; she states the fact and the scroll and passage number where it can be verified.

Reputation: Helga is the most trusted person in the Adamant Vault. Her integrity is considered as strong as the mountain itself. Outsiders find her infuriatingly pedantic and obstructionist, but they know her word, once given, is unbreakable.

IV. Backstory

Defining Moment: Discovering an ancient, pre-Imperium elven text that had been smuggled into the Vault for safekeeping. Reading the elegant, truthful history, and comparing it to the brutal lies of the Imperium's archives, cemented her lifelong crusade to preserve all knowledge against those who would twist it for power.

Relevant History: Helga comes from a long line of lore-keepers and runesmiths. She was identified at a young age for her photographic memory and unwavering integrity, and was groomed to become the next Keeper of the Great Vault. She has spent centuries memorizing the labyrinthine layout of the vaults and the contents of the most important scrolls within. She sees herself not as a librarian, but as the chief witness for all of history, and she will be called to testify one day.

Secrets: Helga knows the location of several "heretical" artifacts and scrolls that even High Lord Borin is unaware of, including a complete, unaltered genealogy of the Empyrean Bloodline that details their madness, and a copy of Lucifer's original confession. She keeps these hidden, believing them to be the world's ultimate insurance policy.

V. Game Mechanics

Feats: Keen Mind, Ritual Caster, Runic Sage (Custom).

Special Abilities / Powers: She is a powerful runesmith, able to inscribe items with potent magical wards and effects. Her knowledge of history is so vast it borders on precognition, allowing her to predict the actions of political entities with uncanny accuracy.

VI. Psychological Deep Dive

1 · Rough portrait Helga is the living memory of a world that desperately wants to forget. She is a woman of stone and ink, whose only faith is in the written word and the power of a sworn oath. She stands guard not just over a vault of gold, but over the very concept of objective truth in a world built on convenient lies. She is the ultimate archivist, and her catalog is the sins of every king and kingdom.

2 · Composite psychological sketch | Dimension | Reading | Personal twist | |---|---|---| | Big Five | [O: 1, C: 5, E: 1, A: 2, N: 2] | Like Borin, her extremely low Openness makes her hostile to new interpretations, but for her, it is about the sanctity of the original record. Her maximum Conscientiousness drives her meticulous and incorruptible nature. | | Dominant defenses | Compulsion, Isolation of Affect | Her life is a series of compulsions and rituals related to preserving and verifying information. She isolates the emotional content of the histories she reads, focusing only on the factual data to avoid being overwhelmed by millennia of tragedy. | | Attachment color | None (Object-focused) | Her primary attachment is to her archives. She treats the scrolls and tablets with more care and reverence than she does any living person. |

3 · Social persona vs. repressed interior

Social persona: The stern, incorruptible archivist. A humorless and pedantic bureaucrat.

Inner person: A secret romantic who is deeply in love with the idea of history itself—the grand, tragic story of the world. She feels a profound connection to the long-dead figures she reads about.

4 · Defense-mechanism diagnostics | Mechanism | Everyday illustration | |---|---|---| | Compulsion | She will triple-check the magical wards on a scroll containing a minor trade agreement with the same intensity as one containing the history of the Great Vanishing. The process is sacred. | | Isolation of Affect | She can read a detailed account of a horrific massacre and her only comment will be to note a discrepancy in the reported number of casualties compared to another source. | | Undoing | After touching a scroll known to be written by an Imperial revisionist, she will ritualistically wash her hands to "cleanse" them of the lie. |

5 · Relational decoding

Attachment script: ["If it is not written, then it did not happen."]

She refuses to act on verbal promises, requiring every agreement to be written, signed, and sealed.

She trusts people based on the consistency and accuracy of their past statements. A single lie can earn her permanent distrust.

6 · Core unconscious beliefs

The past is more real than the present.

A lie can wound the world more than a sword.

I am a witness, not an actor.

7 · Personal myth narrative

Role: The Unseen Archivist

Story told: ["Kings and heroes are but ink on a page; I am the one who keeps the library from burning."]

Comfort: The dry, dusty smell of ancient parchment. Discovering two seemingly unrelated records that corroborate each other. The silent, ordered stillness of her vault.

Toxicity: Her reverence for the past makes her unable to act in the present. She will allow a tragedy to unfold if intervening would violate a past treaty or oath stored in her vault.

8 · Break-point scenario

Catalyst: Finding undeniable proof (perhaps a magical, un-alterable record) that a foundational event she has based her entire worldview on—a key treaty, a historical first-person account—was a complete fabrication from the very beginning.

What fractures: Her core belief in the sanctity of the written record. If history itself can lie, then her entire life's work is meaningless.

Immediate cost: A crisis of purpose so profound she might attempt to seal the Great Vault forever, believing its contents to be a poison, not a cure.

Liberation: Would allow her to understand that truth is not just about facts, but about interpretation and intent, freeing her to use her immense knowledge to actively shape a better future.

9 · Closing pulse She is the world's conscience, and it is a heavy, dusty, and unforgiving book.

### Character Dossier: Durgin "The Breaker" Iron-Hand
#### Part 1: Personality Profile
I. Core Identity

Name: Durgin of Clan Iron-Hand

Archetype/Role: The Passionate Reformer

Occupation/Social Standing: Lord of a young, ambitious dwarven clan; a popular and controversial military leader.

D&D Alignment: (Internal) Neutral Good (Durgin believes that the dwarves' immense power and wealth come with a moral obligation to use it to protect the innocent and fight tyranny, even if it breaks with their tradition of neutrality.)

Myers-Briggs Type (MBTI): (Internal) ENFJ (The Protagonist: A charismatic and inspiring leader, able to charm and persuade others with their passion and idealism. They are driven by a desire to do good in the world.)

II. Psychology & Personality

Core Motivation (The "Why"): To see the Adamant Vault take its rightful place as a force for good in the world. He is disgusted by what he sees as the cowardice and greed of the ruling clans, and wants to use dwarven strength to forge a better world.

Greatest Fear: That his people will be remembered by history as nothing more than greedy, isolationist cowards who sat on their mountain of gold while the world burned.

Key Personality Traits: Idealistic, charismatic, passionate, brave, and sometimes naive.

Quirks & Habits: He speaks with his hands, using broad, emphatic gestures. He is unusually friendly and open for a dwarf, often clapping strangers on the back. He sings old battle-shanties while fighting.

III. Behavior & Speech

Demeanor Under Stress: He becomes more passionate and determined. He thrives on challenge and adversity, seeing it as a chance to prove his ideals. He will make inspiring speeches and lead the charge himself.

Speech Patterns: His voice is a loud, booming baritone, full of passion and conviction. He speaks directly from the heart, with a simple, powerful honesty that resonates with the younger generation and common soldiers.

Reputation: He is a hero to the younger, more idealistic dwarves and to the warriors of the Vault's military. High Lord Borin and the other elder lords see him as a dangerous, naive upstart who threatens to undo centuries of patient work with his reckless idealism.

IV. Backstory

Defining Moment: During a rare surface mission, his patrol defended a human village from a Shattered Host raiding party. The gratitude and courage of the villagers, and the senseless brutality of the raiders, convinced him that the dwarves' neutrality was a moral failure.

Relevant history: Durgin's clan, the Iron-Hands, are known for being warriors and engineers, not bankers. He grew up on tales of ancient dwarven heroes and has always felt a disconnect with the profit-obsessed culture of the Vault's ruling council. He joined the military and quickly became a respected commander, but his constant calls for a more active, interventionist foreign policy have put him in direct opposition to High Lord Borin and the established order.

Secrets: Durgin has been secretly funneling arms and gold to embattled border settlements and even has quiet contacts within the reformist factions of the First-Spear Clans, believing a united front of the "honorable" peoples is the only way to truly defeat both the Imperium and the Host.

V. Game Mechanics

Feats: Heavy Armor Master, Inspiring Leader, Great Weapon Master.

Special Abilities / Powers: A powerful frontline warrior and an inspiring commander. His abilities focus on breaking enemy lines and bolstering the morale of his allies.

VI. Psychological Deep Dive

1 · Rough portrait Durgin is the fiery heart of the mountain, a dwarf who believes that honor is forged in battle, not counted in coin. He is a throwback to an older, more heroic age of dwarven history, a passionate idealist in a culture that has embraced cynical pragmatism. He seeks to reawaken the sleeping giant of his people and lead them back into the light, a quest that will either see him hailed as a savior or crushed by the immense weight of tradition.

2 · Composite psychological sketch | Dimension | Reading | Personal twist | |---|---|---| | Big Five | [O: 4, C: 3, E: 5, A: 4, N: 2] | His extremely high Extraversion and high Agreeableness make him a naturally charismatic and inspiring leader who genuinely cares for others. His high Openness allows him to consider radical new ideas for his people, like foreign alliances. | | Dominant defenses | Idealization, Action as Defense | He idealizes the concept of "dwarven honor" and the common people of the world. He defends against feelings of helplessness or frustration with the council by taking direct, often militant, action. | | Attachment color | Secure | Durgin forms deep, loyal bonds with those who share his ideals. He is trusting and earns fierce loyalty in return because his followers know he would die for them and their shared cause. |

3 · Social persona vs. repressed interior

Social persona: The People's Champion. A brave, charismatic, and inspiring warrior who fights for the common good.

Inner person: A deeply frustrated idealist who feels trapped by his own culture's cynicism. He sometimes harbors a secret resentment for the elders he sees as having sold their people's soul for gold.

4 · Defense-mechanism diagnostics | Mechanism | Everyday illustration | |---|---|---| | Idealization | He sees a simple human farmer defending his home as a symbol of pure, untarnished courage, ignoring the more complex realities of the world. | | Action as Defense | When a negotiation with the council fails, he will immediately leave to lead a training drill with his warriors, channeling his frustration into physical activity. | | Externalization | He blames the world's problems entirely on the "greed" of the council or the "evil" of the Host, sometimes failing to see the more complex, systemic issues. |

5 · Relational decoding

Attachment script: ["If we stand together for what is right, then we cannot fail."]

He builds alliances based on shared values and moral conviction, not on profit or pragmatism.

He is willing to take huge risks for people he has just met, if he believes their cause is just.

6 · Core unconscious beliefs

Wealth is a tool for justice, not an end in itself.

A shield is useless if you never leave the fortress.

The strong have a duty to protect the weak.

7 · Personal myth narrative

Role: The Awakener

Story told: ["My people have slumbered on a bed of gold for too long; I am the hammer-strike that will wake them."]

Comfort: The camaraderie of his warriors after a hard-fought victory. The grateful cheers of villagers he has saved.

Toxicity: His idealism can border on naivety. He might trust untrustworthy allies if they speak the language of justice, and his desire for glorious battle could lead him into traps that a more cynical leader like Borin would easily avoid.

8 · Break-point scenario

Catalyst: Being forced to make a truly horrific choice to achieve a "good" outcome. For example, having to sacrifice an entire town of innocents to win a battle that will save a city of thousands. A situation with no clean, honorable victory.

What fractures: His core belief that doing good is a straightforward path and that his moral compass is infallible.

Immediate cost: A devastating crisis of faith. He would be paralyzed by guilt and doubt, questioning the very nature of heroism and his own crusade.

Liberation: Would force him to develop a more mature and nuanced understanding of morality, tempering his idealism with the pragmatism needed to be a truly effective leader in a complex world.

9 · Closing pulse He wants to be the sword of his people, not realizing he must first shatter the vault that contains it.
