# V1 campaign summary

Sixteen-year-old Ser Arion val Valerion is a newly-sworn Paladin, his loyalty pledged to the prosperous but soulless peace forged by the tyrannical Empress Sariel. His first mission is a brutal test of this loyalty: he is ordered to slaughter innocent refugees sheltered by a "traitorous" noble, Lady Annalise Ashwood. This order forces Arion into a crisis of conscience, pitting his sacred oath to the Imperium's cold law against his personal code of honor. As his disillusionment grows, he is contacted psychically by Aurum, the Gilded King, a magnificent gold dragon offering a different path. Aurum champions a glorious but violent freedom, urging Arion to embrace chaos as the true forge of strength and break the chains of the Empress's stagnant order.

### Campaign Start: The Knight of Two Suns

**Setting the Scene:**  
The wind is a blade of ice in the northern province of Winter-Mourn, but the road beneath your company’s horses is a perfect, white ribbon of Imperial stone, cleared of snow by engineering guilds paid on time. For decades, the Silent Peace of Empress Sariel has held. Bandits are a myth, trade flows uninterrupted, and for the first time in generations, the common folk do not fear the changing of the seasons. This is the peace you swore an oath to protect. You are Ser Arion val Valerion, and at sixteen, your new knighthood feels less like a title and more like a sacred duty to the Empress who forged this stable, prosperous world from the ashes of a cataclysmic war.

This is your first major deployment as a newly-sworn knight in the “Argent Eaglets,” a junior company tasked with enforcing Imperial law in these remote territories. Your mission, delivered by your commanding officer, the stern and ruthlessly pragmatic Prefect Gratian, is a test of your resolve. The March Lord of this province, Lady Annalise Ashwood, has been declared a traitor. Her crime: violating the Provincial Stability Mandate by offering sanctuary to a growing population of refugees, creating an unregistered settlement that attracts predations from the Shattered Host and drains regional resources. The orders are to "pacify" her keep and "disperse" the refugees—a cold euphemism for their slaughter, a necessary evil to prevent a single crack from forming in the Imperium's perfect, unyielding wall. Your father’s words echo in your mind: “Loyalty to the Crown is loyalty to civilization itself.”

**Your Character:**

- **Name:** Ser Arion val Valerion  
- **Age:** 16  
- **Class:** Level 1 Paladin (Oath of the Crown, sworn to Empress Sariel and the Laws of the Imperium)  
- **Background:** Noble Knight of House Valerion. You are a young prodigy of the blade who has only ever known the benefits of the Empress’s rule. Your loyalty to her is intertwined with your loyalty to the peace and order she has created. This mission is the first time you have been forced to see the brutal machinery required to maintain that peace, and your disillusionment is a fresh, painful wound.  

**Gear:**

- **Valerion Plate:** A suit of fine, heavy plate armor, emblazoned with your house's sigil of a steel gauntlet. It is perfectly crafted but not yet enchanted.  
- **"Duty's Edge":** A heavy, perfectly balanced longsword, an heirloom of your house, carried by every firstborn on their first campaign.  
- **The Gryphon Helm:** Your iconic helmet, marking you as a knight of your order.  

**Starting Abilities:**  
You begin with Level 1 Paladin abilities: Divine Sense and Lay on Hands. Your oath to Empress Sariel grants you a deep connection to the laws of the Imperium, which is the source of your nascent holy power.

### The First Mission: The Warden's Choice

The command tent is thick with the smell of wet wool and nervous sweat. Outside, your fellow Eaglets make their final preparations. In your squad, the tension is palpable: Leoric, the apprentice mage, nervously reviews his incantations; Brenna, the sharp-eyed scout, sharpens arrows with a grim focus; and Garrus, the stoic fighter, simply stares at the tent wall, his hand resting on his shield. They are all like you: young, raised in the peace, and now faced with an order that feels deeply wrong. Prefect Gratian dismisses you. "The Empress rewards decisiveness, Ser Arion. Do not hesitate."

You stand vigil outside the tent, the Prefect's order—and thus the Empress's law—a cold, undeniable fact. Your heart is a battlefield. As you stare into the flickering watch-fire, a voice enters your mind. It is not the cold, psychic whisper of the Empress, but a voice of immense warmth and power, like the chime of a great golden bell.

> "Son of Valerion," the voice echoes, a warmth that defies the biting cold. "You believe your oath is to peace. You are mistaken. Your oath is to a cage, polished and silent, where souls go to rust."

An image floods your mind, so vivid it eclipses the world: a magnificent, ancient Gold Dragon, its scales like a thousand sunrises, perched on a snow-dusted mountain peak. Its gaze is not gentle; it is filled with an ancient, predatory intelligence and a profound arrogance.

> "This predictable peace you cherish is a stagnant pond," the voice of the dragon, Aurum, continues, his tone not just righteous, but challenging. "The woman in that keep offers freedom, the chance to strive, to fail, to choose one's own fate—the very things your Empress has stolen from this world. Yes, it is messy. Yes, it is dangerous. But it is life. To slaughter them is to extinguish the last spark of true will in these mountains."

> "Defy your Empress," he commands. "Let chaos be the forge that tempers true strength once more. Swear your blade to a worthy struggle, and I will grant you the power to break the chains of this world, not merely tighten them. Join me, and we will remind this age what greatness looks like."

The vision fades, leaving you breathless, the golden echo of the dragon's voice ringing in your soul. He offers not goodness, but greatness. Not peace, but a glorious, terrible freedom.

### The Choice Before You:

The fate of Lady Ashwood, the refugees, and the very definition of your honor hangs in the balance.

- **Option A: The Path of Order.**  
  Your oath is to the Crown and the stability it provides. You will make the hard choice. The slaughter of these few, while tragic, prevents the potential chaos that could lead to the deaths of thousands and undo the peace your family has fought to maintain. You will suppress your conscience, reaffirm your faith in the system, and carry out your orders as a loyal soldier of the Imperium.

- **Option B: The Path of Freedom.**  
  The dragon’s words ignite a rebellious fire in your soul. The Empress's peace is a lie, a beautiful prison. You will break your oath, openly defy Prefect Gratian, and cast your lot with the charismatic dragon Aurum and the "traitors" in the keep. This is an act of open mutiny, an embrace of a glorious but violent chaos in the name of a higher principle, and it will surely plunge the entire province into war.

- **Option C: The Path of Deception.**  
  You cannot bring yourself to kill the innocent, but you are not yet ready for open treason. You will attempt to subvert the mission from within. You could try to slip away from the camp under the cover of darkness to warn Lady Ashwood, creating a plan for her and the refugees to escape into the wilderness. You will then return to your post and feign ignorance during the "assault" on the now-empty keep, preserving your honor while avoiding open rebellion and buying yourself time to understand the motives of these new, great powers.

**What does your honor command, Ser Arion?**
