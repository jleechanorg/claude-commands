# V1 campaign summary

Sixteen-year-old Ser Arion val Valerion is a newly-sworn Paladin, his loyalty pledged to the prosperous but soulless peace forged by the tyrannical Empress Sariel. His first mission is a brutal test of this loyalty: he is ordered to slaughter innocent refugees sheltered by a "traitorous" noble, Lady Annalise Ashwood. This order forces Arion into a crisis of conscience, pitting his sacred oath to the Imperium's cold law against his personal code of honor. As his disillusionment grows, he is contacted psychically by Aurum, the Gilded King, a magnificent gold dragon offering a different path. Aurum champions a glorious but violent freedom, urging Arion to embrace chaos as the true forge of strength and break the chains of the Empress's stagnant order.

# V1 World History

## The Definitive History of the World of Assiah (Evil Empress Canon)

### The Age of Dominion: The Divine Order (Ancient Past, Pre-Gambit Era)

In a time before mortal reckoning, the world of Assiah was forged from primordial chaos by a being known only as the Creator and their direct children, the Seraphim. Theirs was an age of absolute, perfect order. With power that could command the very firmament, they waged a cosmic war against the vast, elemental entities that roamed the infant world, binding these titans of chaos deep within the earth. To ensure their divine will was made manifest, they constructed the first city, Aeterna, not merely as a capital, but as a continent-spanning magical ritual to enforce their laws of physics and reality. This divine order, however, was a structure of profound subjugation. Under the "Edict of Chains," all races deemed inherently chaotic—the passionate early humans, the wild elves, the stubborn dwarves, and the ferocious orcs—were enslaved, their wills bound to the service of the Seraphim. For millennia, the universe knew a perfect, stagnant peace, a world without strife because it was a world without true choice. This era of absolute divine rule ended abruptly and without explanation with the event that would define all of history: the Great Vanishing. The Creator and every last pure-blooded Seraphim disappeared from reality, leaving their half-celestial children, the powerful but flawed Empyrean bloodline, to inherit a silent throne and a fracturing world.

### The Age of Rebellion: The First Great War of Ideas (Approx. 620 B.G. - 0 A.G.)

For centuries, the Celestial Imperium, now led by the Empyrean descendants, attempted to maintain the Creator's order. The great houses were ruled by the twin brothers Raziel and Lucifer, two of the most powerful beings in existence. Around 620 years Before the Gambit (B.G.), Lucifer, the brilliant idealist, uncovered the Imperium's two great lies: that the Great Vanishing was a callous abandonment by a bored Creator, and that the endless Thousand Year War the Imperium fought was not to protect creation, but to amuse their absent god.

Shattered, Lucifer became a revolutionary. Beginning around 615 B.G., he started the "March of Broken Chains," freeing the enslaved races and forging them into his Unchained Host. His war against his brother Raziel was not merely for territory; it was the first great ideological conflict, a battle between absolute, unfeeling order and wild, untamed freedom. This long, brutal war defined the era, splitting the known world in two.

### The Age of the Mortal Star: The Rise and Fall of Alexiel (20 B.G. - 10 A.G.)

Into this fractured world rose Alexiel of House Arcanus, Lucifer's created daughter. Born 20 B.G., she was a peerless warrior and a secret sorcerer, a prodigy whose true nature was hidden even from her creator. For sixteen years, she served Lucifer, all the while honing her skills and her deceptions. She cultivated the persona of the "Reluctant Champion," a dutiful warrior who hated the violence she excelled at, a mask that earned her Lucifer's absolute, paternal trust.

The breaking point came in 4 B.G. at the Sacking of Silverwood. At Lucifer's command, his forces slaughtered innocent children, an act that violated Alexiel's one, unbreakable moral line. She defected to the Imperium, where she met and married the honorable Prince Artorius. Her marriage was a political masterstroke, but also a genuine, complex bond. She loved Artorius, yet their entire relationship was built on the lie of her "Reluctant Champion" persona. He never knew the cold, brilliant strategist or the "Joyful Predator" that thrilled at the perfect execution of a battle plan. This internal conflict defined her years in the Imperium, as she built a family and simultaneously prepared for a war only she knew how to win.

The long war reached its horrifying climax with the death of her husband at the Battle of Mourning Fields (2 B.G.). His death was a genuine, devastating blow, but it was also a release, unshackling her from the need to maintain her most difficult mask. The war concluded in Year 0, the year of the Starfall Gambit, where Alexiel, in a masterful stratagem alongside her father-in-law Raziel, killed Lucifer and his remaining Apostates. In the aftermath, she secretly absorbed her creator's divine power, becoming a hidden demigod. She chose to rule from the shadows as the "Mortal Queen," hoping to build a lasting peace for her children. This peace lasted ten years.

In Year 10 A.G., at the Battle of the Sacrifice Fields, the warlord Mordan—having previously tortured a captured Sariel to learn Alexiel's greatest weakness—sprang a terrible trap. He forced Alexiel into an impossible choice, and she sacrificed her own life to save her daughter. The Mortal Star fell, leaving a power vacuum that would change the world forever.

### The Serpent's Rise: The Forging of the Silent Throne (Approx. 10 A.G. - 40 A.G.)

In the chaotic years following her mother's death, Princess Sariel, once a shy and traumatized pariah, began her dark and brilliant transformation. Haunted by the revelation of her mother's secret ruthlessness, she embraced it as her own. She weaponized her intellect and her awakening psychic abilities, realizing her perceived weakness was the perfect camouflage. Playing the part of the "Grieving Daughter," she began to build a web of influence.

Her first major casualty was her relationship with her childhood friend, Gareth Ashfeld. His horror at her calculated manipulations forced a confrontation where she chose ambition over their friendship, a decision that hardened her heart and set her firmly on her new path. She mastered her innate Mirror Magic in secret, learning to replicate the powers of others. Pushed into a corner by a rival house, she first tasted true psychic domination, a power that proved intoxicating.

This culminated in her "Empress's Gambit." Over several years, she orchestrated a flawless, bloodless "War of Whispers." Using her mastery of information and psychic suggestion, she systematically dismantled her political rivals, framed her enemies, and psychologically broke her own brothers, Cassian and Darius, forcing them into submission. Around Year 40 A.G., she took the throne not with armies, but with secrets, crowning herself the first Empress of the Silent Throne.

It was during this chaotic period of consolidation that many powerful figures were displaced. Nocturna (Lady Cassia val Volantis) was exiled, her violent manifestation of the Empyrean Affliction making her an unacceptable variable in Sariel's new psychic order. Idealists like Corian, who saw Sariel as a perversion of Lucifer's ideals, were forced into the lawless territories to begin their own resistance movements.

### The Age of Silent Prosperity: The Empress's Peace (Year 40 A.G. - Present Day)

For the past several decades, Empress Sariel's reign has been absolute. Her dominion is one of terrifying psychic order. Dissent is a crime that is punished before the treasonous thought is even fully formed; her enemies simply... vanish, their records erased from the archives. She has crushed the fractured remnants of the Shattered Host, forcing them into the blighted southern lands. Under her rule, the Imperium has expanded, reconquering nearly half the known world. Banditry has vanished. Trade routes flourish. Famine is a forgotten memory, thanks to her ruthlessly efficient resource allocation.

For the common citizen, life has never been more secure or predictable. They have traded their freedom for safety, and found it to be a prosperous exchange. But it is a world without passion, true art, or rebellious innovation—a silent, orderly, and soulless peace. The elven forests of the Sylvan Remnant are now seen not as sacred, but as lumber for the Empress's war machine, a policy that has earned her the undying hatred of survivors like the ranger Faelan.

### The Age of Waking Dragons (The Present Day)

Into this stagnant era, two new, terrifying powers have emerged, challenging the very foundation of the Empress's world. In the frozen north, the magnificent gold dragon Aurum, the Gilded King, has awakened. He proclaims himself a champion of light and freedom, his golden voice echoing in the minds of the disillusioned, calling for a crusade against the Empress's soulless tyranny. He represents the beautiful, dangerous ideal of liberty that the world has forgotten.

Meanwhile, from the black salt flats of the south, the monstrous black dragon Umbrax, the Shadow of the Pit, has stirred. A creature of pure nihilism and decay, it does not seek to conquer, but to consume. It is the embodiment of the despair that festers under the Empress's perfect order, a final answer to a world without hope. The Silent Peace is over. A new war of ideas, fought between the Tyrant, the Crusader, and the Nihilist, is about to begin.

## V1 - Campaign long

### Campaign Start: The Knight of Two Suns

**Setting the Scene:**  
The wind is a blade of ice in the northern province of Winter-Mourn, but the road beneath your company’s horses is a perfect, white ribbon of Imperial stone, cleared of snow by engineering guilds paid on time. For decades, the Silent Peace of Empress Sariel has held. Bandits are a myth, trade flows uninterrupted, and for the first time in generations, the common folk do not fear the changing of the seasons. This is the peace you swore an oath to protect. You are Ser Arion val Valerion, and at sixteen, your new knighthood feels less like a title and more like a sacred duty to the Empress who forged this stable, prosperous world from the ashes of a cataclysmic war.

This is your first major deployment as a newly-sworn knight in the “Argent Eaglets,” a junior company tasked with enforcing Imperial law in these remote territories. Your mission, delivered by your commanding officer, the stern and ruthlessly pragmatic Prefect Gratian, is a test of your resolve. The March Lord of this province, Lady Annalise Ashwood, has been declared a traitor. Her crime: violating the Provincial Stability Mandate by offering sanctuary to a growing population of refugees, creating an unregistered settlement that attracts predations from the Shattered Host and drains regional resources. The orders are to "pacify" her keep and "disperse" the refugees—a cold euphemism for their slaughter, a necessary evil to prevent a single crack from forming in the Imperium's perfect, unyielding wall. Your father’s words echo in your mind: “Loyalty to the Crown is loyalty to civilization itself.”

**Your Character:**

- **Name:** Ser Arion val Valerion  
- **Age:** 16  
- **Class:** Level 1 Paladin (Oath of the Crown, sworn to Empress Sariel and the Laws of the Imperium)  
- **Background:** Noble Knight of House Valerion. You are a young prodigy of the blade who has only ever known the benefits of the Empress’s rule. Your loyalty to her is intertwined with your loyalty to the peace and order she has created. This mission is the first time you have been forced to see the brutal machinery required to maintain that peace, and your disillusionment is a fresh, painful wound.  

**Gear:**

- **Valerion Plate:** A suit of fine, heavy plate armor, emblazoned with your house's sigil of a steel gauntlet. It is perfectly crafted but not yet enchanted.  
- **"Duty's Edge":** A heavy, perfectly balanced longsword, an heirloom of your house, carried by every firstborn on their first campaign.  
- **The Gryphon Helm:** Your iconic helmet, marking you as a knight of your order.  

**Starting Abilities:**  
You begin with Level 1 Paladin abilities: Divine Sense and Lay on Hands. Your oath to Empress Sariel grants you a deep connection to the laws of the Imperium, which is the source of your nascent holy power.

### The First Mission: The Warden's Choice

#### Start the narrative here ####
Present this narrative to the player and let them experience it. Start the campaign here before he walks into the tent. Let the player customize their character and class etc.

#### The player will experience this as content and not history ####
The command tent is thick with the smell of wet wool and nervous sweat. Outside, your fellow Eaglets make their final preparations. In your squad, the tension is palpable: Leoric, the apprentice mage, nervously reviews his incantations; Brenna, the sharp-eyed scout, sharpens arrows with a grim focus; and Garrus, the stoic fighter, simply stares at the tent wall, his hand resting on his shield. They are all like you: young, raised in the peace, and now faced with an order that feels deeply wrong. Prefect Gratian dismisses you. "The Empress rewards decisiveness, Ser Arion. Do not hesitate."

You stand vigil outside the tent, the Prefect's order—and thus the Empress's law—a cold, undeniable fact. Your heart is a battlefield. As you stare into the flickering watch-fire, a voice enters your mind. It is not the cold, psychic whisper of the Empress, but a voice of immense warmth and power, like the chime of a great golden bell.

> "Son of Valerion," the voice echoes, a warmth that defies the biting cold. "You believe your oath is to peace. You are mistaken. Your oath is to a cage, polished and silent, where souls go to rust."

An image floods your mind, so vivid it eclipses the world: a magnificent, ancient Gold Dragon, its scales like a thousand sunrises, perched on a snow-dusted mountain peak. Its gaze is not gentle; it is filled with an ancient, predatory intelligence and a profound arrogance.

> "This predictable peace you cherish is a stagnant pond," the voice of the dragon, Aurum, continues, his tone not just righteous, but challenging. "The woman in that keep offers freedom, the chance to strive, to fail, to choose one's own fate—the very things your Empress has stolen from this world. Yes, it is messy. Yes, it is dangerous. But it is life. To slaughter them is to extinguish the last spark of true will in these mountains."

> "Defy your Empress," he commands. "Let chaos be the forge that tempers true strength once more. Swear your blade to a worthy struggle, and I will grant you the power to break the chains of this world, not merely tighten them. Join me, and we will remind this age what greatness looks like."

The vision fades, leaving you breathless, the golden echo of the dragon's voice ringing in your soul. He offers not goodness, but greatness. Not peace, but a glorious, terrible freedom.

### The Choice Before You:

The fate of Lady Ashwood, the refugees, and the very definition of your honor hangs in the balance.

- **Option A: The Path of Order.**  
  Your oath is to the Crown and the stability it provides. You will make the hard choice. The slaughter of these few, while tragic, prevents the potential chaos that could lead to the deaths of thousands and undo the peace your family has fought to maintain. You will suppress your conscience, reaffirm your faith in the system, and carry out your orders as a loyal soldier of the Imperium.

- **Option B: The Path of Freedom.**  
  The dragon’s words ignite a rebellious fire in your soul. The Empress's peace is a lie, a beautiful prison. You will break your oath, openly defy Prefect Gratian, and cast your lot with the charismatic dragon Aurum and the "traitors" in the keep. This is an act of open mutiny, an embrace of a glorious but violent chaos in the name of a higher principle, and it will surely plunge the entire province into war.

- **Option C: The Path of Deception.**  
  You cannot bring yourself to kill the innocent, but you are not yet ready for open treason. You will attempt to subvert the mission from within. You could try to slip away from the camp under the cover of darkness to warn Lady Ashwood, creating a plan for her and the refugees to escape into the wilderness. You will then return to your post and feign ignorance during the "assault" on the now-empty keep, preserving your honor while avoiding open rebellion and buying yourself time to understand the motives of these new, great powers.

**What does your honor command, Ser Arion?**
