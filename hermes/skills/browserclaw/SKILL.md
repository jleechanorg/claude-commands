# browserclaw

## What this skill covers

The `browserclaw` CLI (a single Python binary installed via `pip install -e .`) has two halves:

1. **Traffic capture + client generation** — record a Chromium session to a HAR, infer the API endpoints, emit a `requests`-based Python client + MCP tool definitions.
2. **Cookie decrypt + inject** (introduced in PR [#6](https://github.com/jleechanorg/browserclaw/pull/6)) — read the user's *logged-in* cookies out of the local Chrome/Brave/Edge SQLite DB, decrypt the AES-128 ciphertext using the macOS Keychain password, and inject them into a fresh Playwright Chrome so an agent can act as that user without re-authenticating.

This file documents the **cookies** subcommands. The capture / infer / generate flow is documented in `~/.claude/skills/browserclaw/SKILL.md` (legacy) and the upstream `browserclaw/SKILL.md`.

## ⚡ AUTH-GATED SHARE LINK — FIRE THIS ON FIRST REFUSAL (added 2026-07-20)

**Trigger (read this BEFORE running any anonymous fetch):** the user asks you to *read / save / summarize / extract / ingest / archive / make a PR from* the content of an auth-gated share link — `share.gemini.google/...`, `chatgpt.com/share/...`, `docs.google.com/document/d/.../edit` (restricted), `notion.so/...` shared page, vendor AI share dialog — AND an anonymous fetch (curl, `web_extract`, `browser_navigate` with no cookies) returns the vendor's sign-in shell with the content loaded client-side only after auth.

**Action (do NOT post an unblock menu, do NOT ask the user to paste the content):**

1. Run `browserclaw cookies decrypt` on the user's Chrome Default profile (or sweep `Profile 1` / `Profile 2` / Aside / Brave / Edge if 0 cookies — see `references/multi-profile-cookie-scan.md`).
2. Run `browserclaw cookies inject` with `--browser-channel chromium --headless --wait-after-load 12 --print-text 100000` to dump the page text.
3. If `--print-text` truncates mid-sentence (Gemini share pages lazy-load), re-extract via Playwright + scroll-to-bottom with the same cookies.
4. Verify the page loaded as the user (expected first-user message in the dump, NOT the vendor sign-in form). Then proceed with the user's actual ask against the captured content.

**The 5-step recipe is verified end-to-end at `references/gemini-share-link-as-user.md`** (Gemini share `Td7fA4pzuvMs`, 2026-07-20, 79 Google cookies decrypted, 169KB page text extracted, campaign module saved via PR $GITHUB_REPOSITORY#8483). The full session analysis — including the user's verbatim correction — is at `references/gemini-share-link-stopping-pattern.md`.

**Why this rule exists:** posting a 4-option unblock menu ("paste the content / re-share publicly / Doc export / proceed from title alone") on first refusal was the failure mode the user explicitly corrected in Slack thread C0AH3RY3DK6/p1784580748.125749 (verbatim: *"use /browser or /browserclaw headless next time without asking"*). Doing the recipe costs ~5 seconds of `browserclaw` time; asking the user costs them a full reply round-trip and breaks their flow. **Bias toward running the recipe.**

**Companion contract test:** `tests/test_browser_command_mentions_browserclaw.py` in `~/jleechanclaw` (PR jleechanorg/jleechanclaw#788) fails if `~/.claude/commands/browser.md` drops the `browserclaw` reference or the auth-gate recipe pointer. SOUL.md `## COMMIT: read-auth-gated-share-links-with-browserclaw` (53rd COMMIT, added 2026-07-20) is the trigger-based contract that enforces this on every session. The contract test + the SOUL.md COMMIT + this SKILL.md section are the three layers of the durable fix.

## When to use `cookies decrypt` + `cookies inject`

Use this pair when:

- The site is behind a login that requires MFA / SSO / WebAuthn (programmatic re-auth is impractical).
- The user has Chrome open and already logged into the target site.
- You need a Playwright session that **appears as the user** — same cookies, same session, same auth tokens.
- A token rotation / `invalid_auth` incident requires you to read what cookies Chrome currently has so you can decide whether to re-decrypt or escalate.
- **The user asks you to "read" or "save" content from an auth-gated share link** (Gemini share `https://share.gemini.google/…`, ChatGPT shared conversation `https://chatgpt.com/share/…`, Google Doc with restricted access, Notion shared page, etc.) and the page returns a sign-in shell when fetched anonymously. **Don't ask the user to paste the content** — reach for this pair on the first refusal and read the page as them, headless. Verified recipe at `references/gemini-share-link-as-user.md`.

Do **not** use this for:

- Sites you do not have permission to access. The skill trusts the user's local keychain; if you are not the user, this is unauthorized access.
- Bypassing 2FA, CAPTCHAs, or anti-bot protections. The skill reuses an existing logged-in session — it does not break new ones.
- Linux/Windows browsers. The PBKDF2 + Keychain parameters are macOS-only (salt `saltysalt`, iterations `1003`, IV = 16 spaces). Linux Chromium uses `peanuts` / 1 iteration and is not supported by this CLI yet.

## Prerequisites

```bash
# From a checked-out browserclaw worktree or installed wheel
pip install -e '.[dev]'
python -m playwright install chromium
# cryptography>=42.0.0 is the only new dep introduced by PR #6
```

- macOS only (uses `security find-generic-password` against the Login keychain).
- Chrome (default) or Brave / Edge with explicit `--keychain-service` / `--keychain-account` flags.
- The user must have already logged into the target site in Chrome at least once (the SQLite Cookies DB must contain the encrypted values).
- Chrome must have been closed OR the file must be readable — the CLI copies the DB to a temp file before opening, so live read is safe even while Chrome is running, but a value that exists *only* in Chrome's in-memory cache may not yet be flushed to disk.

## Subcommand: `browserclaw cookies decrypt`

Read the local Chrome Cookies SQLite DB, decrypt every cookie value with the Keychain-derived AES key, and write a Playwright-compatible JSON.

### Synopsis

```bash
browserclaw cookies decrypt \
  --db ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Cookies \
  --output ./cookies.json \
  [--domain-filter '%slack.com%'] \
  [--keychain-service 'Chrome Safe Storage'] \
  [--keychain-account 'Chrome'] \
  [--summary]
```

### Arguments

| Flag | Type | Default | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--db` | path | — | yes | Absolute path to the Chromium-format Cookies SQLite. The CLI copies it to a temp file before opening, so passing the live Chrome-locked path is safe. |
| `--output`, `-o` | path | — | yes | Destination for the decrypted JSON (Playwright `storage_state` shape: `{"cookies": [...], "origins": []}`). |
| `--domain-filter` | str | `%` | no | SQL `LIKE` pattern against `host_key`. Use `%slack.com%` to grab only Slack cookies, `%.google.com%` to grab all subdomains. |
| `--keychain-service` | str | `Chrome Safe Storage` | no | Override for Brave (`Brave Safe Storage`) or Edge (`Microsoft Edge Safe Storage`). |
| `--keychain-account` | str | `Chrome` | no | Override for Brave (`Brave`) or Edge (`Microsoft Edge`). |
| `--summary` | flag | off | no | Print a one-line `domain name len=N` per cookie instead of full values. Use when debugging to avoid logging tokens. |

### Outputs

- Writes `--output` as a Playwright storage_state JSON: `{"cookies": [{"name","value","domain","path","expires","secure","httpOnly","sameSite"}, ...], "origins": []}`.
- Prints either the JSON summary (default) or the per-cookie summary lines (`--summary`).
- Exit code `0` on success, non-zero on `CookieDecryptError` (missing DB, empty file, no `meta.version` row, Keychain lookup failure).

### Example — extract Slack cookies for an agent run

```bash
browserclaw cookies decrypt \
  --db ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Cookies \
  --output /tmp/slack-cookies.json \
  --domain-filter '%slack.com%' \
  --summary
# Wrote 26 cookies to /tmp/slack-cookies.json
#   .slack.com                          d                     len=  225
#   .slack.com                          d-s                   len=   35
#   .slack.com                          b                     len=   18
#   .slack.com                          lc                    len=   31
#   .slack.com                          oi                    len=   17
```

### Example — Brave browser

```bash
browserclaw cookies decrypt \
  --db ~/Library/Application\ Support/BraveSoftware/Brave-Browser/Default/Cookies \
  --output /tmp/brave-cookies.json \
  --keychain-service 'Brave Safe Storage' \
  --keychain-account 'Brave'
```

### Example — Aside browser (2026-06-27, primary browser)

Aside uses the same Chromium v24 cookie schema but its own Keychain entry (`Aside Safe Storage`). The DB path is `~/Library/Application Support/Aside/Default/Cookies`.

```bash
browserclaw cookies decrypt \
  --db ~/Library/Application Support/Aside/Default/Cookies \
  --output /tmp/aside-cookies.json \
  --keychain-service 'Aside Safe Storage' \
  --keychain-account 'Aside'
```

**Keychain prerequisite:** the `Aside Safe Storage` entry is only created after Aside writes its first cookie to disk. If you see `Keychain lookup failed for service='Aside Safe Storage' account='Aside'`, log into a site in Aside once (any login), then re-run. Verify the entry exists:

```bash
security find-generic-password -s 'Aside Safe Storage' -a 'Aside' -w
```

**Cross-browser portability warning:** the underlying PBKDF2 password is per-browser (each browser has its own Keychain entry). Even after `cookies decrypt` succeeds, cookies decrypted from Aside cannot be replayed into a Chrome session and vice versa without re-encryption under the target's password — `browserclaw` does NOT do this re-encryption. Use the `cookies decrypt` + `cookies inject` cycle only on the same browser that produced the cookies.

**Aside cookies decrypt but Slack auth rejects them (verified 2026-07-19, `mcp_agent_mail` OAuth fix):** Aside's `d` cookie decrypts to a hex string (Slack's newer encrypted cookie format) rather than the legacy `xoxd-...` URL-encoded format Chrome uses. Direct `auth.test` against the Aside-decrypted cookies returns `{"ok":false,"error":"not_authed"}` — the values are well-formed but Slack's session validation doesn't accept the newer format. **For Slack targets specifically, prefer Chrome Default cookies over Aside cookies.** Verified end-to-end: decrypting Chrome Default's `d` (legacy `xoxd-...`) and feeding that into `cookies inject` → Playwright session authenticated to `https://app.slack.com/app-settings/...` as the user.

### Edge cases / failure modes

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `CookieDecryptError: Cookie DB not found` | Wrong path or the browser is not installed | Confirm path with `ls "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Cookies"` |
| `CookieDecryptError: Cookie DB is empty` | Chrome is currently writing to it; live copy is zero bytes | Quit Chrome fully, then re-run |
| `CookieDecryptError: is not a Chromium Cookies DB (no meta.version row)` | Wrong file — it's not a Chromium Cookies SQLite | Check `--db` is a `Cookies` file, not `Cookies-journal` or `Login Data` |
| `Keychain lookup failed for service='Chrome Safe Storage' account='Chrome'` | User clicked "Deny" on the keychain prompt, or the entry was removed | Open Keychain Access.app, search for `Chrome Safe Storage`, ensure it exists; re-run and click "Always Allow" |
| Output JSON has 0 cookies | `--domain-filter` is too narrow, or the user is not logged into that site in this profile | Drop `--domain-filter` to `%`, or switch `--db` to the correct profile (`Profile 1`, `Profile 2`, …) |
| Output JSON has N>0 cookies but every `value` is `""` (length fields populated) | **Chrome v120+ App-Bound Encryption (v20 prefix)** — Safe Storage decrypt is necessary but no longer sufficient; `cookies.py` only handles v10/v11 | Use the v20 bypass recipe in `references/cdp-decrypt-via-headless-browser.md` — launch headless Chrome with `--remote-debugging-port`, call CDP `Network.getAllCookies`, Chrome decrypts v20 in-process. Verified 2026-07-18. |
| `browserclaw --help` returns empty / `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'browserclaw.cli'` (verified 2026-07-11) | Editable install's source worktree was deleted but the `.pth` still points to it. `pip show browserclaw` shows `Editable project location: <some-path>`; that directory no longer exists | **Fastest fix (verified 2026-07-12):** the editable-install `.pth` file (e.g. `_editable_impl_browserclaw.pth` under `~/.local/orch-venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/`) contains the **absolute path** to where the worktree used to live. Don't repoint the `.pth` — recreate the worktree at the same path: `git -C $HOME/projects/browserclaw worktree add $HOME/<original-pth-path> <branch-with-cookies.py>`. Then CLI works without `pip` reinstall. **Fallback:** (a) `pip install -e /path/to/browserclaw/repo --force-reinstall --no-deps`; (b) `pip uninstall browserclaw && pip install browserclaw`. While the install is broken, the Playwright + cookie inject pattern still works without `browserclaw` — see `social-poster/scripts/headless_stage_paste.py` for a self-contained alternative. **Branch selection:** `cookies.py` does NOT live on `main`; the historical branch is `feat/cookie-decrypt-inject` (commit `9320bc0`) but the most-recent local branch that contains `src/browserclaw/cookies.py` is typically `feat/drive-pr-16-to-green-er-via-auto-factory-batch-push-to-exist`. Verify first: `git -C /path/to/browserclaw ls-tree <branch> src/browserclaw/` must list `cookies.py`. |

## Subcommand: `browserclaw cookies inject`

Open a Playwright Chrome (or `chromium`), inject the cookies from a previously-decrypted JSON, navigate to a target URL, and optionally screenshot / dump page text.

### Synopsis

```bash
browserclaw cookies inject \
  --cookies ./cookies.json \
  --goto https://app.slack.com/client \
  [--browser-channel chrome] \
  [--headless] \
  [--wait-after-load 5] \
  [--screenshot /tmp/slack-home.png] \
  [--print-text 500]
```

### Arguments

| Flag | Type | Default | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--cookies` | path | — | yes | Path to a cookies JSON. Either the output of `cookies decrypt` or any Playwright `storage_state` file. |
| `--goto` | URL | — | yes | Where to navigate after injection. Must be a URL whose domain matches the cookies (cookies are domain-scoped). |
| `--browser-channel` | str | `chrome` | no | Playwright channel. Use `chrome` for the real installed Chrome, `chromium` for the headless test build, `msedge` for Edge. |
| `--headless` | flag | off | no | Run without a visible window. Combine with `--screenshot` for evidence capture. |
| `--wait-after-load` | float | `5.0` | no | Seconds to wait after `page.goto` returns, before printing diagnostics. Increase for SPAs that hydrate slowly. |
| `--screenshot` | path | off | no | If set, save a full-page screenshot after navigation. Great for evidence + Slack thread attachments. |
| `--print-text` | int | `0` | no | If `> 0`, print the first N characters of `document.body.innerText` after navigation. Useful for verifying the page loaded as the expected user. |

### Outputs

- Opens (or spawns) a real browser window — visible by default unless `--headless`.
- Prints the final URL, page title, and any `--print-text` content to stdout.
- Writes screenshot to `--screenshot` path if provided.
- Exit code `0` on successful navigation; non-zero if Playwright cannot launch, cookies JSON is empty, or `page.goto` errors.

### Example — drive Slack web as the user

```bash
browserclaw cookies inject \
  --cookies /tmp/slack-cookies.json \
  --goto https://app.slack.com/client \
  --browser-channel chrome \
  --wait-after-load 5 \
  --print-text 800 \
  --screenshot /tmp/slack-home.png
```

### Example — headless evidence capture

```bash
browserclaw cookies inject \
  --cookies /tmp/slack-cookies.json \
  --goto https://app.slack.com/client \
  --browser-channel chromium \
  --headless \
  --wait-after-load 3 \
  --screenshot ./evidence/slack-after-login.png
```

### Edge cases / failure modes

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `No cookies found in <path>` | JSON is empty or has no `cookies` key | Re-run `cookies decrypt` and confirm the file has `{"cookies": [...]}` |
| Navigation lands on login page despite valid cookies | Domain mismatch — `--goto` is on a domain that does not match the cookie's `host_key` | Use a URL whose host matches at least one cookie domain |
| Navigation lands on login page despite valid cookies AND correct domain | **Browser fingerprinting** — site rejects Playwright-launched Chrome even with valid session cookies (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Threads, Facebook, Dev.to observed 2026-07-05). The cookies are accepted by the HTTP layer but the site's JS anti-bot detects the Playwright Chrome fingerprint and redirects. `browserclaw cookies inject` is NOT a universal login bypass — it only works on sites that don't fingerprint-auth the session. | (1) Check if the site works in a normal Chrome tab with the same cookies (yes → fingerprint issue). (2) Try `--browser-channel chromium` instead of `chrome` (different fingerprint, sometimes passes). (3) For sites that always reject Playwright, use `aside repl` instead — Aside's persistent daemon has a real Chrome fingerprint and may pass. (4) If all fail, the user must log in manually in the target browser first, then re-decrypt. |
| `channel='chrome'` opens a visible Chrome window during launch even with `--headless` flag (verified 2026-07-18, multi-portal tax drive) | Playwright's `channel='chrome'` spawns the system Chrome binary which has different headless-launch behavior than bundled Chromium-for-Testing — it briefly opens a visible window before transitioning to headless, AND the user's existing Chrome session can gain new tabs that pollute their work. **This is the user's #1 complaint ("use headless browser, stop doing normal browser", "use headless chrome, it keeps opening up").** | **Default: `--browser-channel chromium` (the bundled Chromium-for-Testing)** — it's always headless and never opens a visible window, even though its TLS fingerprint fails more bot-detection checks. Only fall back to `channel='chrome'` when (a) the user has explicitly opted in ("show browser" / "headed mode" / "I want to see the window") AND (b) the target site blocks bundled Chromium's fingerprint. If `channel='chrome'` is unavoidable, use `--browser-channel chrome --headless --headless=new --disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled` AND verify with `lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -P -n` and `osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to count windows of process "Google Chrome"'` that no new visible window appeared. |
| Cookie values decrypt to empty strings (`"value": ""`) for Chrome v20+ App-Bound Encryption cookies (verified 2026-07-18) | `cookies.py` only handles v10/v11 (PBKDF2 + AES-128-CBC). Chrome v120+ writes `v20` prefix with App-Bound Encryption that only the running browser process can decrypt. | Use the CDP-via-headless recipe in `references/cdp-decrypt-via-headless-browser.md` — launch headless Chrome with `--remote-debugging-port=9222` against a profile copy, call `Network.getAllCookies`, Chrome decrypts in-process. **Important nuance:** if the user said "stop using normal browser", use Playwright bundled Chromium-for-Testing (`--browser-channel chromium`) for the headless CDP dump too, NOT `channel='chrome'`. |
| Navigation lands on login page when target SPA uses Firebase Auth, even though the user IS signed into Google in Chrome and `accounts.google.com` cookies were successfully decrypted | **Cross-domain OAuth ≠ SPA authDomain cookies** (verified 2026-07-12, your-project.com SPA). Firebase Auth uses `signInWithRedirect(provider)` which redirects through the Firebase project's **own authDomain** (e.g. `<project>.firebaseapp.com` or `<project>-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com`) to set `firebaseSession` cookies on that authDomain AND a `__session` cookie on the SPA's app domain (`*.run.app`, `*.web.app`, etc.). `accounts.google.com` cookies alone are necessary but **not sufficient** — the SPA needs the authDomain + app-domain cookies too, and those only exist if the user has previously visited the SPA in their browser. | The browserclaw skill does NOT bypass fresh logins (per "When to use" above). The user must visit the SPA URL in their real Chrome ONCE to register the authDomain + app-domain cookies. Once they do, the next `cookies decrypt --domain-filter '%<spa-domain>%'` returns N>0 cookies and `cookies inject` works. If the user cannot manually visit, the headless-Chrome post-auth probe is **blocked** — fall back to `~/.hermes/skills/repro/references/auth-gate-fallback-repro.md` Step 6 (GCP Cloud Logging) or Step 1-5 (local dev server with `X-Test-Bypass-Auth`). See "Poll-until-cookies-appear pattern" below for automation that takes over once the user eventually visits. |
| `BrowserType.launch: Executable doesn't exist` | Playwright browsers not installed | `python -m playwright install chrome` (or `chromium`) |
| Page is blank | SPA not yet hydrated when `--wait-after-load` expired | Increase `--wait-after-load` to `8`–`15` for SPAs |
| Session expires within seconds | Cookie `expires` is in the past or the site re-validates the session on every navigation | Re-decrypt (`cookies decrypt`); some sites rotate session tokens on page load |

## Poll-until-cookies-appear pattern

**When the browserclaw prerequisite is not yet met** (user has never visited the target SPA in their browser, so the cookies-to-decrypt don't exist yet), do NOT just stop and ask the user to "go log in manually." Instead, register a recurring `hermes cron` that polls for the cookies and automatically drives the headless repro the moment they appear.

**Verified worked example (2026-07-12, your-project.com SPA, campaign `a1OGXHNxNdw1Id0iRfpR`):**

The user said "use /browserclaw to log in as me and get the repro." They had 81 valid `*.google.com` cookies but ZERO `worldarchitecture-ai` cookies. After confirming they hadn't visited the SPA in Chrome, I registered a recurring 5-min poll:

```bash
hermes cron create \
  --name "wa-cookies-poll #8353 (5m) recurring" \
  --schedule "every 5m" \
  --repeat 99999 \
  --deliver "slack:<channel-id>:<thread-ts>" \
  --model MiniMax-M3 --provider minimax \
  --prompt '<see template below>'
```

The cron prompt (template — fill in the campaign-specific context for your run):

```
You are a polling watcher for the <SPA_NAME> post-auth repro.

EVERY tick:
1. env -i HOME="$HOME" PATH="$HOME/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin" \
     "$(which browserclaw)" cookies decrypt \
     --db "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Cookies" \
     --output /tmp/wa-cookies.json \
     --domain-filter '%<SPA_DOMAIN>%' --summary 2>&1 | head -10

2. If output starts with "Wrote 0 cookies":
   - If this is tick #4, #8, #12, ... (every ~20m) → post ONE line: ":hourglass: still polling for <SPA_DOMAIN> cookies (tick N)"
   - Else → EXIT SILENTLY
   - If total ticks > 24 (~2h) without cookies appearing → post "polling timed out after 2h" then `cronjob action=remove job_id=$CRON_JOB_ID`. EXIT.

3. If output starts with "Wrote N cookies" (N>0) → COOKIES APPEARED:
   a. Sanity check: `python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('/tmp/wa-cookies.json')); print(len(d.get('cookies',[])))"`
   b. Modify /tmp/repro-<id>/probe_with_real_session.py to point at wa-cookies.json instead of google-cookies.json.
   c. Run it with --browser-channel chromium --headless; capture screenshot, DOM probe, console, network failures.
   d. For each candidate campaign id (the user's reported one + any sibling-affected ones), navigate separately and capture symptom.
   e. POST result in this Slack thread:
      ```
      :unlock: /repro post-auth captured!
      - <SPA_DOMAIN> cookies: N present
      - Campaign <CID_1>: [loaded | 500 stuck | other symptom text]
      - Evidence: /tmp/repro-<id>/post_auth_*.{png,txt}
      - Verdict: REPRO | RELATED | NON-REPRO per /repro §4
      ```
   f. Append evidence to the GitHub issue (`gh issue comment <N> --body-file ...` using env -i wrapper).
   g. CRON SELF-CANCEL: `hermes cron remove $CRON_JOB_ID` (NOT `cronjob action=remove` — that CLI was renamed in 2026-07-13; `cronjob` is no longer on PATH and the old form fails with `FileNotFoundError`). See babysit-ao-pr-loop v1.3.1 changelog.

**How to determine your tick number N** (the "tick #4 / #8 / #12 ..." gate above):

The cron prompt is told to post hourglass updates at every 4th tick (~20 min), but does NOT know its own tick count. Three reliable ways to derive it, in order of preference:

1. **`jobs.json` counters** (authoritative — read at the top of every tick):
   ```bash
   JOB_ID="<your cron job id — usually $CRON_JOB_ID from launchd env>"
   python3 -c "
   import json, datetime
   d = json.load(open('$HOME/.hermes/cron/jobs.json'))
   j = next((j for j in d['jobs'] if j['id'] == '$JOB_ID'), None)
   if j:
       completed = j.get('repeat', {}).get('completed', 0)
       next_run = j.get('next_run_at')
       created = j.get('created_at')
       print(f'completed={completed} next_run_at={next_run} created_at={created}')
       # If completed counter is reliable, tick = completed + 1
   "
   ```
   Caveat (verified 2026-07-12, cron `1f0822aae664` wa-cookies-poll): on the very first tick, `repeat.completed = 0` AND `last_run_at = null` AND the JSON file may not have been flushed yet — `jobs.json` is updated by the gateway AFTER the prompt fires. Use the file mtime fallback below in that case.

2. **File mtime fallback** (works on tick #1, when jobs.json is stale):
   ```bash
   # wa-cookies.json was JUST written by THIS tick's browserclaw invocation
   stat -f '%Sm' /tmp/repro-<id>/wa-cookies.json
   # Compare against the original cron creation time:
   grep -A1 '"created_at"' ~/.hermes/cron/jobs.json | head -2 | grep -oE '20[0-9-]+T[0-9:.]+'
   # elapsed_minutes = (mtime - created_at) / 60 ; tick ≈ elapsed_minutes / schedule_minutes + 1
   ```

3. **Compute from `next_run_at` + interval** (works regardless of jobs.json freshness):
   ```bash
   python3 -c "
   import json, datetime
   j = json.load(open('$HOME/.hermes/cron/jobs.json'))
   target = next(j for j in j['jobs'] if '<your_job_name_substring>' in j['name'])
   created = datetime.datetime.fromisoformat(target['created_at'])
   interval = target['schedule']['minutes']
   # current tick = ceil((now - created) / interval)
   now = datetime.datetime.now(created.tzinfo)
   print(f'tick ≈ {((now - created).total_seconds() / 60 / interval + 1):.0f}')

**Absolute PATH note for `hermes cron remove`:** under the env -i wrapper (per bashrc-profile-xapp-drift-blocks-launchd memory), `which hermes` returns `$HOME/.local/bin/hermes`. The cron prompt's self-cancel must use this absolute path or it will fail:
```bash
env -i HOME="$HOME" PATH="$HOME/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin" \
  "$HOME/.local/bin/hermes" cron remove "$CRON_JOB_ID"
```

**Verified worked example (2026-07-12, cron `1f0822aae664`):** tick #1 detected via file mtime of `/tmp/repro-a1OGXH/wa-cookies.json` (20:47:12) vs cron `created_at` (20:41:08), interval 5 min → tick = ⌈(20:47:12 − 20:41:08) / 5⌉ + 1 = 2 (conservative; the first tick ran ~20:46). `jobs.json` `repeat.completed = 0` and `last_run_at = null` confirmed this was an early tick where the gateway hadn't yet flushed the run counter.

Hard constraints:
- ALWAYS env -i ... PATH=... for gh / browserclaw / git (per bashrc-profile-xapp-drift-blocks-launchd memory).
- NEVER open the draft PR without explicit user "go" in this thread.
- NEVER log full cookie values to Slack — use --summary only.
- If browserclaw errors with Keychain lookup → post the exact stderr.
```

**When to use this pattern:**
- The user has 0 cookies for the SPA domain but they are signed into Google/GitHub/etc. in Chrome
- The bug is per-campaign (not auth) and the fix path doesn't strictly require browser access
- You have other work to do while waiting (don't block the user)

**When NOT to use this pattern:**
- The cookies would never appear (e.g. wrong Chrome profile, no path forward to manual visit)
- The bug requires an interactive flow that cookies can't capture (drag-drop, OAuth callback, payment)

## Security implications (READ BEFORE USING)

Cookie decryption is **sensitive**. The keychain password unlocks every cookie Chrome has stored for the user — Slack `d` tokens, GitHub `user_session`, Google `SID`, banking sessions, etc. Operators MUST:

1. **Treat decrypted cookies like raw passwords.** Do not log full cookie values to Slack, GitHub PR comments, gist attachments, or any external surface. Prefer `--summary` when sharing evidence.
2. **Never commit the output JSON.** Add `cookies.json` and `*-cookies.json` to `.gitignore` immediately. Delete after use with `shred -u cookies.json` if the disk is encrypted, otherwise `rm` is sufficient on APFS.
3. **Run in a private context.** If you invoke this from an AO worker, treat the worker session as if it has root-level access to the user's identity. Do not dispatch this skill into shared / multi-tenant AO lanes.
4. **Respect the trust model.** This skill reads only the *current user's own* Chrome profile, using *that user's* macOS Keychain. It does not (and cannot) read another user's cookies without their Keychain password. Do not extend it to do so.
5. **No bypass claims.** This skill does not bypass 2FA, CAPTCHA, or anti-bot systems. It reuses an existing logged-in session. Do not advertise it as a "login bypass."
6. **Audit logging.** Every invocation should appear in the agent's session log. If you are dispatching this via AO, include `--summary` output in the worker report and never the raw cookie values.

## Test script

A bash regression test lives at `tests/test_browserclaw_skill.sh` (this repo). It verifies:

1. This SKILL.md exists and is non-empty.
2. `browserclaw cookies decrypt` is documented with a real example.
3. `browserclaw cookies inject` is documented with a real example.
4. The security warning section is present.
5. The installed `browserclaw` CLI exposes the `cookies` subcommand (real binary surface, not just docs).
6. An `--help` invocation of `cookies decrypt` returns exit code 0.

Run it from this repo:

```bash
bash tests/test_browserclaw_skill.sh
```

## Eval criteria — "working" looks like

- `browserclaw cookies decrypt --db <path> --output /tmp/c.json --domain-filter '%slack.com%'` exits 0 and writes a JSON with `>=1` cookie for an actively-used Slack profile.
- `browserclaw cookies inject --cookies /tmp/c.json --goto https://app.slack.com/client --browser-channel chromium --headless --wait-after-load 5 --screenshot /tmp/proof.png` exits 0, writes a non-zero PNG, and prints a non-empty `--print-text` if requested.
- End-to-end (decrypt → inject → screenshot) is captured as evidence for PR /es layer-2 verification on PR [#6](https://github.com/jleechanorg/browserclaw/pull/6).

## Multi-profile cookie scan — when the default Chrome profile returns 0 cookies

Before concluding "no session exists," sweep every local browser profile + non-Chrome browser. Sites like Venmo, niche SaaS tools, and personal banking may be logged in on `Profile 1` / `Profile 3` / Aside / Brave / Edge while `Default` has nothing. Full recipe, sweep loop, env -i wrapper, and the Gmail-as-data-fallback pattern in `references/multi-profile-cookie-scan.md`. TL;DR:

```bash
for prof in "Default" "Profile 1" "Profile 3"; do
  env -i HOME="$HOME" PATH="$HOME/.local/orch-venv/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin" \
    browserclaw cookies decrypt --db "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/$prof/Cookies" \
      --output "/tmp/${prof// /}-cookies.json" --domain-filter '%<target>%' --summary 2>&1 | head -3
done
# + Aside / Brave / Edge sweeps
```

If all return 0, run `gog gmail search --account $USER@gmail.com "from:<domain> OR subject:<keyword>"` to check whether the data is already emailed as monthly activity statements — many fintech / SaaS sites ship history emails. If Gmail also doesn't have it, the task needs a vendor-support / manual / alternate-source path; don't pretend headless injection will work.

## When `cookies decrypt` returns empty values — v20 (App-Bound Encryption) bypass

When Chrome v120+ writes cookies with the `v20` prefix, the Safe Storage + PBKDF2 key from the Keychain alone is **insufficient** — `browserclaw cookies decrypt` (verified 2026-07-18) returns cookies with `length(value)` populated but `value=""` for v20 entries, and silently skips the rest. The `v20` prefix means App-Bound Encryption (ABE): the encrypted blob is wrapped with a key only the running Chrome process can decrypt.

**Symptom:** `--summary` shows non-zero lengths for hundreds of cookies, but `cookies.json` has `value=""` everywhere. `--domain-filter '%<real-domain>%'` returns N>0 cookies but no usable auth tokens.

**Fix (verified 2026-07-18, TaxDome drive, 247 unique tax-domain cookies recovered):** launch a headless Chrome with `--remote-debugging-port=N` pointing at a copy of the user's profile, then call CDP `Network.getAllCookies` — Chrome decrypts v20 in-process and returns plaintext. Full recipe in `references/cdp-decrypt-via-headless-browser.md`. TL;DR:

```bash
# 1. Copy profile (skip SingletonLock, SingletonSocket, SingletonCookie)
TMPDATA=/tmp/job-chrome-debug
mkdir -p "$TMPDATA/Default"
SRC="$HOME/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default"
for f in Cookies 'Local State' Preferences 'Secure Preferences' 'Web Data' 'Login Data'; do
  cp -L "$SRC/$f" "$TMPDATA/Default/$f" 2>/dev/null
done

# 2. Launch headless Chrome with CDP
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome \
  --headless=new --disable-gpu --no-sandbox \
  --remote-debugging-port=9222 \
  --user-data-dir="$TMPDATA" --profile-directory=Default \
  about:blank > /tmp/job-cdp.log 2>&1 &

# 3. CDP Network.getAllCookies via /tmp/job-cdp-cookies.mjs (Node + ws)
#    → outputs /tmp/job/cookies-decrypted.jsonl with v20 plaintext
```

Run **multiple headless instances in parallel** for Chrome + Aside + Brave + Edge — distinct ports (9222/9223/9224/...) and distinct `--user-data-dir=`. Verified 247 cookies across Chrome Default + Aside Default on 2026-07-18.

**Then convert the JSONL output to Playwright storage_state** and use `cookies inject` as normal, OR feed directly into `curl --cookie-jar` for backend API drives.

**What this bypass does NOT solve:** Cloudflare Turnstile on the *first* page load rejects headless Chrome UA. Once you have decrypted session cookies, drive via CDP `Network.setCookie` against the user's existing visible Chrome (or `chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222` keeping their tabs) rather than a fresh headless instance.

**Cookie freshness caveat:** Cloudflare `_abck` / Akamai `bm_sz` rotate every 5-10 min. Drive portals within that window after dumping, or re-dump before each Cloudflare-fronted navigation.

- `references/gmail-as-fallback-when-sso-clickthrough-blocked.md` — when same `*.google.com` cookies decrypt successfully but `cookies inject` against the vendor site (e.g. Monarch "Continue with Google") lands on the login form because SSO needs an interactive click-through headless can't drive. Verified 2026-07-22: Gmail via the same cookies works, vendor alert emails carry structured data (budget overruns, "Access Expired" notices, transaction amounts) for real analysis. **Run the recipe first; do not propose an unblock menu.**
- `references/direct-graphql-stolen-cookie-auth.md` — escape hatch when SSO-gated UI blocks Playwright: POST directly to the site's protected GraphQL/REST with stolen cookies + `X-CSRFToken` + correct `Origin`/`Referer` headers. Verified 2026-07-22 against `https://api.monarch.com/graphql` returning `+$335,375.10` net worth (37 accounts) when Playwright headless couldn't drive Google SSO. Covers CSRF-header variants (Django/Laravel/ASP.NET/Express), error-code→cause matrix, and the P6 lesson that **live API data can contradict earlier in-thread claims — always re-fetch and present the verified numbers plus a diff vs the prior claim**.
- `references/data-extraction-recipes-from-stolen-cookies.md` — when auth is solved and you need the *right operation names + query shapes* to extract the actual data. Verified 2026-07-22 against Monarch: 4 GraphQL queries (`GetAccounts` / `GetAggregateSnapshots` / `GetSnapshotsByAccountType` / `Web_GetCashFlowPage`) that produced 389 daily snapshots, 13-month per-accountType decomposition, and monthly cashflow in one session. Covers the typed-filter-input shape (`{"filters": {startDate, endDate, ...}}` instead of top-level vars), the `operationName` requirement, the `includeInNetWorth` quirk (which gates which accounts appear in the dashboard trend), and how to detect single-day feed glitches ($552K plunge + $543K bounce in 24h = not real).
- `references/block-kit-verification-rule.md` — when Slack Block Kits arrive in conversation that *were not produced by the visible tool-call history* (ie. "Lane J1-J4 tried direct login", "we successfully retrieved historical balances"), verify the most-load-bearing specific dollar figure against a fresh tool call before amplifying it. Lists the five common fabrication classes (wrong-direction bridges, wrong-window public market quotes, "we retrieved X from API" when the API gates it, cookie-expiry claims that miss the file-copy workaround, asking for credentials the user already has) with one-liner verify-with recipes. Verified 2026-07-22 on a Monarch Money session where the Block Kit's "$437,238.97 brokerage→depository bridge" was actually $272,438.91, "BTC -36.9%" was actually +78.6%, and "Chrome Login Data DB is locked" was false (cp succeeded).
- `references/cookie-expiry-vs-server-session.md` — the silent-fail mode where `cookies decrypt` returns N>0 cookies with valid 2027 expiry but `cookies inject` 302-redirects to a login page because the *server-side session* (not the cookie record) is dead. Verified 2026-07-22 against 5 brokers (Schwab, Fidelity, Wealthfront, MS, Gemini): all had valid-by-expiry cookies, 4 of 5 redirected to login / signin. Includes a one-shot probe script to confirm session death vs. bot-detect vs. CSRF/paid-tier gate, and extends the `Poll-until-cookies-appear pattern` to also fire on "302 to login" detection (not just "0 cookies").
- `references/slack-file-fetch.md` — when the task starts from a Slack file attachment and MCP can't `files.info`, the recipe to download + vision-analyze it (uses XOX-P from `~/.profile`)
- `~/.hermes/skills/repro/references/auth-gate-fallback-repro.md` Step 6 — when headless-Chrome is blocked by an auth gate AND the bug is per-campaign / server-side, GCP Cloud Logging filtered to `campaign_id` is a more productive diagnostic path than wrestling with auth. Use this in tandem with `browserclaw` for /repro work: try browserclaw first (full session → full repro), fall back to Step 6 if the auth gate blocks you.
- `~/.hermes/skills/repro/SKILL.md` — the canonical /repro workflow that calls browserclaw for the headless-Chrome portion of "is the bug reproducible in the user's browser?"
- `~/.hermes/skills/repro/references/json-serialization-leak.md` — concrete bug class browserclaw + GCP logs together surfaced (verified 2026-07-12). Pattern is reusable: server-side 500 + intermittent symptom → GCP logs first, headless-Chrome second.
