## ⚡ EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE
**When this command is invoked, YOU (Claude) must execute these steps immediately:**
**This is NOT documentation - these are COMMANDS to execute right now.**
**Use TodoWrite to track progress through multi-phase workflows.**

## 🚨 EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Automatic Thinking & Planning

**Action Steps:**
**🧠 ALWAYS START WITH `/think`:**
Execute `/think` to analyze:
1. Current PR context and changed files
2. Git diff analysis against main branch
3. Frontend vs backend changes identification
4. Risk assessment for functionality impacts
5. Test strategy prioritization

### Phase 2: Plan Adaptation

**Action Steps:**
**🎯 IF USER PROVIDED INSTRUCTIONS:**
Adapt the plan based on user input after `/testuif`:
1. Parse user requirements and constraints
2. Modify testing scope and priorities accordingly
3. Integrate user-specific test scenarios
4. Adjust comparison strategy as requested

**📋 DEFAULT COMPARISON STRATEGY:**
When no specific instructions given:
5. Test ALL functionality from Flask frontend in React V2
6. Ensure feature parity between old and new sites
7. Validate critical user journeys work identically
8. Document any missing or broken functionality

### Phase 3: Systematic Execution

**Action Steps:**
**⚡ ALWAYS USE `/execute`:**
Use `/execute` with comprehensive testing plan:

```
/execute
1. MANDATORY: Generate complete field interaction matrix (Campaign Type × Character × Setting × AI Options)
2. Apply smart matrix testing strategy (pairwise combinations + high-risk prioritization)
3. Set up browser automation environment (Playwright MCP with headless=true)
4. Execute Phase 1: High-risk matrix combinations (25 critical tests)
5. Execute Phase 2: Feature coverage matrix (35 comprehensive tests)
6. Execute Phase 3: Edge case matrix (20 boundary tests)
7. Test Flask frontend functionality (baseline) - ALL matrix paths
8. Test React V2 equivalent functionality - ALL matrix paths with dynamic placeholder verification
9. Compare feature parity with matrix cell-by-cell evidence
10. Document matrix findings with clickable screenshot links
11. Perform adversarial testing on previously failing matrix cells
12. Generate matrix coverage report with bug pattern analysis
13. Post comprehensive matrix results to PR documentation
```

### Phase 4: Enhanced PR Documentation with Claude Vision Analysis

**🔍 CLAUDE VISION INTEGRATION WORKFLOW:**
```bash

## 📋 REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION

# Intelligent Regression Testing with Playwright MCP

**Purpose**: Perform comprehensive regression testing using `/think` and `/execute`, comparing old Flask site to new React V2 site with full functionality validation

**Action**: Always use `/think` to analyze context, then `/execute` for systematic testing. Adapts plan based on user input after command.

**Usage**:
- `/testuif` (automatic analysis and testing)
- `/testuif [specific instructions]` (adapts plan to user requirements)

## Execution Protocol

## 🚨 MANDATORY QUALITY ASSURANCE INTEGRATION

**Quality Assurance Protocol**: See [CLAUDE.md §Mandatory QA Protocol](/CLAUDE.md#-mandatory-quality-assurance-protocol). All browser testing MUST comply.

### 📋 Pre-Testing Requirements (⚠️ MANDATORY)

- **Matrix Testing**: Apply full matrix methodology per canonical protocol
- **Evidence Collection**: Screenshot every test matrix cell with path labels
- **Completion Validation**: All validation gates from QA protocol required
- **Code Scanning**: Search for hardcoded values and patterns systematically
- **Adversarial Testing**: Attempt to break claimed fixes and verify related patterns
```

**🚨 MANDATORY HEADLESS CONFIGURATION:**
```bash

# Environment variables for headless enforcement

export PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS=1
export BROWSER_HEADLESS=true

# Playwright MCP configuration with explicit headless flag

mcp__playwright-mcp__browser_navigate --headless=true --url="http://localhost:8081"
mcp__playwright-mcp__browser_take_screenshot --headless=true --filename="baseline.png"
```

## 🔍 Enhanced Screenshot Validation Protocol (2025)

**INTEGRATION**: Based on latest AI testing research, use advanced validation methods:

### **Method 1: Claude Vision Direct Analysis (Primary)**

```bash

# Capture screenshots to filesystem for Claude vision analysis

TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
VALIDATION_DIR="/tmp/testuif_validation/$TIMESTAMP"
mkdir -p "$VALIDATION_DIR"

# Flask baseline screenshots

mcp__playwright-mcp__browser_take_screenshot --name="flask_dashboard" --path="$VALIDATION_DIR/flask_dashboard.png"
mcp__playwright-mcp__browser_take_screenshot --name="flask_campaign_creation" --path="$VALIDATION_DIR/flask_campaign_creation.png"

# React V2 comparison screenshots

mcp__playwright-mcp__browser_take_screenshot --name="react_dashboard" --path="$VALIDATION_DIR/react_dashboard.png"
mcp__playwright-mcp__browser_take_screenshot --name="react_campaign_creation" --path="$VALIDATION_DIR/react_campaign_creation.png"

# Claude analyzes screenshots directly using Read tool

echo "Screenshots saved to $VALIDATION_DIR for Claude vision analysis"
```

### **Method 2: Accessibility Tree + Visual Hybrid**

```bash

# Get structured accessibility data alongside screenshots

mcp__playwright-mcp__browser_snapshot > "$VALIDATION_DIR/flask_accessibility.json"
mcp__playwright-mcp__browser_snapshot > "$VALIDATION_DIR/react_accessibility.json"

# Cross-validate structured data with visual confirmation

# Claude can read both JSON accessibility data AND screenshot images

```

### **Method 3: Progressive Baseline Comparison**

```bash

# Create baselines if they don't exist

if [ ! -d "/tmp/testuif_baselines" ]; then
    mkdir -p /tmp/testuif_baselines
    echo "Creating baseline screenshots for future comparisons"
    mcp__playwright-mcp__browser_take_screenshot --path="/tmp/testuif_baselines/flask_baseline.png"
fi

# Compare current state against established baselines

# Use Claude vision to analyze differences between baseline and current screenshots

```

**🚨 FAILURE-EXIT SEMANTICS:**
```bash

# Exit codes for parity check failures

PARITY_CHECK_PASSED=0    # All functionality matches
PARITY_CHECK_FAILED=1    # Feature parity failures detected
CRITICAL_ERROR=2         # Browser automation or system errors

# Bail-on-failure implementation

set -e  # Exit immediately on any command failure
set -o pipefail  # Fail on any pipe command failure

# Example parity validation with non-zero exit

validate_feature_parity() {
    local flask_result="$1"
    local react_result="$2"

    if [ "$flask_result" != "$react_result" ]; then
        echo "❌ PARITY FAILURE: Feature mismatch detected"
        echo "Flask: $flask_result"
        echo "React: $react_result"
        exit $PARITY_CHECK_FAILED
    fi

    echo "✅ PARITY VERIFIED: Feature behavior matches"
    return 0
}
```

# After capturing screenshots, perform Claude vision analysis

for screenshot in "$VALIDATION_DIR"/*.png; do
    echo "Analyzing $(basename $screenshot) with Claude vision..."
    # Claude reads and analyzes each screenshot for:
    # - Hardcoded values detection ("Ser Arion", "Loading campaign details...")
    # - UI consistency verification
    # - Feature parity validation
    # - Visual regression detection
done

# Generate structured analysis reports

echo "Screenshots ready for Claude vision analysis at: $VALIDATION_DIR"
