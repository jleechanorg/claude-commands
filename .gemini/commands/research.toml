## Research Protocol

### Phase 1: Research Planning

**Deep Analysis**:
1. Analyze the research topic systematically
2. Define specific research questions and objectives
3. Identify potential information sources
4. Plan search strategies
5. Anticipate knowledge gaps and validation needs

### Phase 2: Multi-source Information Gathering

**Comprehensive Search Execution**:
1. Web search for current information and recent developments
2. Deep research with citations and recency controls
3. Alternative perspectives and sources
4. Technical documentation and official sources
5. Cross-validate information across sources
6. Extract and organize findings by source and credibility

### Phase 3: Deep Analysis Integration

**Sequential Thinking Applied to Results**:
1. Synthesize findings from all sources
2. Identify patterns, trends, and contradictions
3. Evaluate source credibility and recency
4. Generate insights beyond individual source limitations
5. Develop evidence-based conclusions

### Phase 4: Structured Documentation

**Research Summary with Methodology Transparency**:
1. Research Planning: Show analysis process
2. Information Sources: Document search results by source
3. Analysis Integration: Present synthesis of findings
4. Conclusions: Evidence-based recommendations with attribution

## Execution Standards

- ✅ **Verified Sources**: Confirm content before citing
- ✅ **Access Tracking**: Document which sources were successfully read
- ❌ **Unverified Citations**: Never present URLs as evidence without reading
- ❌ **Assumption Claims**: Never claim content based on search descriptions

## Research Integrity Protocol

1. **Search ≠ Sources**: Search results are leads, not verified evidence
2. **Fetch Before Cite**: Only cite URLs after successfully reading content
3. **Transparent Failures**: Report when sources couldn't be accessed
4. **Evidence-Based Claims**: All assertions must trace to read content

## Output Format
