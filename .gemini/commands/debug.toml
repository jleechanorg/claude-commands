## Debug Command - Systematic Issue Resolution

Debug the following issue:

{{args}}

## Debug Checklist

Ensure all items are checked:
- [ ] Exact error messages captured
- [ ] Stack traces include file:line references
- [ ] DOM inspector output captured (for UI issues)
- [ ] CSS computed properties extracted (for visual elements)
- [ ] Network request logs captured (for asset loading)
- [ ] Console errors/warnings documented
- [ ] Reproduction steps documented
- [ ] Hypotheses explicitly stated
- [ ] Evidence supports conclusions
- [ ] Fix validated with tests
- [ ] Anti-bias check: "What should NOT be working?" tested

## Debug Methodology

1. **Reproduce**: Establish consistent reproduction steps
2. **Isolate**: Narrow down the problem scope
3. **Technical Verification**: Auto-extract DOM state, CSS properties, network requests, console logs
4. **Hypothesize**: Form theories about root cause
5. **Test**: Validate hypotheses with evidence
6. **Evidence Collection**: Screenshot + technical data + verification report
7. **Fix**: Apply targeted solution
8. **Verify**: Confirm fix resolves issue
9. **Learn**: Capture debugging insights and patterns

## Debug Output Characteristics

- **Stack traces**: Full traces with line numbers
- **Variable states**: Key variable values at each step
- **Execution flow**: Clear path through the code
- **Hypothesis tracking**: Document what was tried
- **Evidence citations**: Reference specific errors/logs

## Examples

- `/debug "API returns 500 error"` - Systematic debugging for error source
- `/debug "flaky test failures"` - Tests with verbose output for intermittent issues
- `/debug "memory leak in production"` - Deep analysis with instrumentation

## Debug Categories

- **🚨 Critical Patterns**: Root causes that prevent major failures
- **⚠️ Mandatory Steps**: Required validation steps
- **✅ Successful Techniques**: Effective hypothesis testing
- **❌ Anti-Patterns**: Approaches that led to dead ends
