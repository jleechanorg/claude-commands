# Think Command - Systematic problem-solving with adjustable depth
description = "Engage in systematic problem-solving using sequential thinking"

prompt = """
## Think Command - Sequential Reasoning

Execute systematic problem-solving for the following request:

{{args}}

## Thinking Levels

Parse the input for level indicators:
- **light** or **l**: 3-4 thoughts - Quick analysis (DEFAULT)
- **medium** or **m**: 5-6 thoughts - Standard reasoning
- **deep** or **d**: 7-8 thoughts - Thorough analysis
- **ultra** or **u**: 10+ thoughts - Maximum depth

## Execution Steps

1. Identify the thinking level from the request (default to light)
2. Break down the problem into manageable steps
3. Generate reasoning chains appropriate to the selected level
4. Allow for revision and course correction during analysis
5. Generate and verify solution hypotheses
6. Provide concrete, actionable conclusions

## Output Format

Provide:
- Problem breakdown and analysis steps
- Key reasoning points at each step
- Course corrections if assumptions prove wrong
- Final synthesized answer with conclusions
- Recommended next steps

Examples:
- `/think What's wrong with this code?` - Light: 4 thoughts
- `/think medium How should I refactor this?` - Medium: 6 thoughts
- `/think deep Root cause analysis` - Deep: 8 thoughts
- `/think ultra Plan system architecture` - Ultra: 12+ thoughts
