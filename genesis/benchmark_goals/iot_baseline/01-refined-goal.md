2. ✅ InfluxDB time-series database for efficient sensor data storage
3. ✅ WebSocket connections for real-time data streaming to dashboard
4. ✅ Redis for caching and pub/sub messaging between components
5. ✅ Device registration and authentication system with API keys
6. ✅ Data ingestion API with validation and batch processing support
7. ✅ Real-time alerting system with configurable thresholds and notifications
8. ✅ Web dashboard with real-time charts and device status monitoring
9. ✅ Device management interface for configuration and monitoring
10. ✅ Data retention policies and automated cleanup procedures
11. ✅ Basic user authentication and role-based access control
12. ✅ Docker containerization with docker-compose for easy deployment
13. ✅ Environment configuration with settings management
14. ✅ Requirements.txt with Flask ecosystem dependencies
15. ✅ Basic logging and error handling throughout the application
