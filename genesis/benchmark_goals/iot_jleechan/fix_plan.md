## GENESIS PLAN MAINTENANCE COMPLETE

**PRIORITY SCORING ITERATION 1 RESULTS:**

### CRITICAL RESTRUCTURE PERFORMED
- **Removed**: All PostgreSQL multi-tenant tasks (goal mismatch identified)
- **Added**: IoT platform-specific tasks aligned with InfluxDB foundation
- **Prioritized**: Goal alignment resolution as Priority 10 (critical blocker)
- **Reorganized**: 13 actionable tasks across 6 priority levels with clear dependencies

### KEY PRIORITY DECISIONS
**Priority 10**: Goal alignment resolution + WebSocket implementation (critical path)
**Priority 9**: Flask app structure + device authentication + data pipelines (core foundation)
**Priority 8**: Analytics engine + Docker integration + monitoring (platform completion)
**Priority 7-5**: Dashboard, scaling, documentation (enhancement features)

### DEPENDENCY MAPPING
- **✅ Completed Foundation**: InfluxDB client with 235 lines production code
- **Next Blocker**: WebSocket framework selection for real-time communication
- **Critical Path**: Goal alignment → WebSocket → Flask APIs → Analytics → Production deployment

### ARCHITECTURE STATUS PRESERVED
- **17% completion** accurately reflected
- **Enterprise-grade foundation** with InfluxDB infrastructure documented
- **Cerebras acceleration velocity** metrics maintained for future iterations
