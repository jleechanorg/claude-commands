Install dependencies (flask, flask-socketio, influxdb-client)  \n2. Create templates directory structure\n3. Set up InfluxDB environment variables\n4. Execute test suite validation\n5. Launch application and verify real-time data streaming\n\n### CONTEXT\nThe Genesis Enhanced Workflow has successfully generated a sophisticated enterprise-scale IoT monitoring platform foundation. The Cerebras-generated code demonstrates production-ready patterns including proper error handling, authentication, time-series data storage, and comprehensive testing coverage. The platform is ready for immediate integration testing and can scale to handle multiple concurrent IoT devices with real-time data visualization.\n\n**File Structure Generated**:\n- `app.py`: Main Flask-SocketIO application (158 lines)\n- `test_websocket.py`: Comprehensive test suite (140 lines) \n- `templates/websocket_client.html`: Web client interface (79 lines)\n\nThe implementation follows enterprise patterns with proper separation of concerns, environment-based configuration, and robust error handling throughout the data pipeline.\n\n[Local: proto-genesis-timeout-improvements | Remote: origin | PR: N/A]",
