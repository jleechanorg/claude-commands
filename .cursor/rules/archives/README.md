# Archives Directory

This directory contains archived and backup versions of documentation files that are kept for historical reference but are not actively maintained or monitored for size.

## Contents

- `lessons_archive_2024.mdc` - Archived lessons from before November 2024
- `lessons_backup_*.mdc` - Backup files created during major documentation updates

## Purpose

- **Historical Reference**: Preserve old lessons and patterns for reference
- **Size Management**: Keep large archive files out of active documentation monitoring
- **Performance**: Prevent archived content from affecting API read performance

## Note

These files are excluded from:
- Documentation size monitoring tests
- API performance checks
- Active maintenance

If you need to reference old content, you can find it here, but these files should not be modified or added to active documentation.
