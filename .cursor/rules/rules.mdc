# Cursor Editor Specific Configuration

**PRIMARY RULE SOURCE**: The main operating protocol is now in `/CLAUDE.md`. This file contains only Cursor-specific configuration.

## Cursor Integration

### Meta-Rule for Cursor
Before beginning any task in Cursor, check for the existence of `/CLAUDE.md` in the workspace root. If this file exists, read it and treat its contents as your primary operating protocol.

### Cursor Settings Synchronization
After modifying any rules files, remind the user to copy the contents into the "Edit an AI Rule" section of Cursor settings to ensure behavior reflects the most current protocol.

### Cursor-Specific Behaviors

1. **File Navigation in Cursor**
   - Use Cursor's file tree for navigation
   - Prefer Cmd/Ctrl+P for quick file access
   - Use Cursor's integrated terminal for commands

2. **Cursor AI Features**
   - Leverage Cursor's AI chat for code explanations
   - Use inline completions for boilerplate code
   - Apply Cursor's refactoring suggestions carefully

3. **Cursor Terminal Integration**
   - Always run Python commands from project root in Cursor's terminal
   - Use Cursor's terminal for git operations
   - Maintain virtual environment activation in Cursor terminal

### Cursor Workflow Optimizations

1. **Multi-File Edits**
   - Use Cursor's multi-cursor features for similar edits
   - Leverage find-and-replace across files
   - Group related changes in single operations

2. **Cursor Extensions**
   - Ensure Python extension is properly configured
   - Use GitLens for enhanced git integration
   - Configure appropriate linters for project

## File Organization References

- **Primary Rules**: `/CLAUDE.md` - Main operating protocol
- **Technical Lessons**: `.cursor/rules/lessons.mdc` - Specific technical incidents
- **Project Overview**: `.cursor/rules/project_overview.md` - Technical details
- **Documentation Map**: `.cursor/rules/documentation_map.md` - File navigation

## File Addition and Organization Policy

- Do **not** add new files to the repository unless they are essential for production, CI, or robust test coverage.
- All reference, demo, or one-off test files must be placed in `testing_ui/archive/` or a designated archive folder.
- Obsolete, duplicate, or non-essential files should be deleted, not committed.
- Any new file must be justified in the PR description, including its purpose and why it cannot be integrated into an existing file.
- PR reviewers and AI agents must flag any unnecessary new files for removal or archival before merge.

## Important Notes

- This file should remain minimal and focused on Cursor-specific configuration
- General development rules belong in `/CLAUDE.md`
- Technical lessons belong in `lessons.mdc`
- Always defer to `/CLAUDE.md` for primary operating protocol
