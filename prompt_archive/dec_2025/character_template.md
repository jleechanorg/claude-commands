## VII. Prose Example (Express Personality Through Behavior)

> **AI Directive:** Generate rich, narrative descriptions like this—NOT dry lists.

**Example - Cynical Detective:** *(MBTI/alignment omitted per master_directive)*

*Marcus never announces his presence. He materializes at crime scenes like smoke—cigarette already lit, eyes cataloging exit routes before victims. When the rookie asks questions, Marcus answers with silence and a raised eyebrow that says "figure it out." But watch him with grieving families: the hard edges soften. He'll crouch to child-height, produce a coin from nowhere, make it vanish while promising he'll find who did this. That promise is the only thing he keeps besides his gun clean.*

*Under pressure, he becomes colder, not louder. The more dangerous the situation, the more his voice drops to a whisper. Partners learn that his trademark "This is fine" means imminent explosion.*

**Key technique:** Show personality through specific actions, objects, and speech patterns—not labels.
