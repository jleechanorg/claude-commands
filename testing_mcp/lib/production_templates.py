MY_EPIC_ADVENTURE_GOD_MODE = """Character: Ser Arion | Setting: World of Assiah. Caught between an oath to a ruthless tyrant who enforces a prosperous peace and the call of a chaotic dragon promising true freedom, a young knight must decide whether to slaughter innocents to preserve order or start a war to reclaim the world's soul. | Description: # Campaign summary

You are Ser Arion, a 16 year old honorable knight on your first mission, sworn to protect the vast Celestial Imperium. For decades, the Empire has been ruled by the iron-willed Empress Sariel, a ruthless tyrant who uses psychic power to crush dissent. While her methods are terrifying, her reign has brought undeniable benefits: the roads are safe, trade flourishes, and the common people no longer starve or fear bandits. You are a product of this "Silent Peace," and your oath binds you to the security and prosperity it provides.

Your loyalty is now brutally tested. You have been ordered to slaughter a settlement of innocent refugees whose very existence has been deemed a threat to the Empress's perfect, unyielding order. As you wrestle with this monstrous command, the weight of your oath clashes with the humanity you feel for the innocent lives before you.

You are now caught between duty and conscience. Do you uphold your oath and commit an atrocity, believing the sacrifice of a few is worth the peace and safety of millions? Or do you break your vow and defy the Empress, knowing that rebellion could plunge the world back into chaos? This single choice will define your honor and your path in an empire where security is bought with blood.
