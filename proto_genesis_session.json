A companion decision, made earlier in the TDD generation stage and reaffirmed here, was to halt forward progress on new functionality until the missing \u201cGOAL: [specific technical description]\u201d is supplied, ensuring no placeholder logic or mis-scoped work violates the no-TODO policy. By honoring the search validation signal instead of fabricating fresh scaffolding, the workflow maintained strict one-task-per-loop compliance while gathering authoritative runtime evidence about the current system state. No other branching decisions were possible because every higher-level instruction gates implementation on receiving that absent technical brief, so the operative strategy remained: confirm test behavior, document findings, and await the required scope definition.\n\nESSENTIAL FINDINGS: Executing the complete enhanced Genesis test battery revealed 13/13 successful passes, contradicting earlier logs that described a retry-loop failure; this indicates that, under the present environment and repository snapshot, the workflow progresses through stages A1, A2, B-series, helper utilities, and temporary file operations without error. The pathway confirms that core helper functions\u2014`cerebras_call`, `execute_codex_command`, `smart_model_call` for both Claude and Codex, and tmp-file data flow\u2014are operational, suggesting that any previously observed looping failure was context-dependent and not reproduced in this run. Despite the green test suite, every instruction block still references \u201cGOAL: [specific technical description]\u201d without providing content, leaving the team unable to derive acceptance criteria, edge cases, or integration behaviors for new work; this absence remains the central blocker preventing fresh TDD cycles. Repository context stays stable (`danger-full-access`, no approvals, high reasoning) and there are no uncommitted modifications, confirming that external constraints are not impeding progress. These findings collectively reduce the immediate suspicion of code regressions in the Genesis engine yet elevate the need to capture the precise user goal that originally triggered the retry-loop description, because without replicating that scenario the observed pass status may not represent the failing condition described by the search validator.\n\nNEXT FOCUS: Secure the exact technical goal definition that should populate the bracketed placeholder so that the next execution loop can draft goal-specific tests or replicate the retry-loop scenario; acquiring that detail unlocks the ability to either construct targeted failing tests or adjust runtime parameters to expose the documented issue. Once the goal is in hand, re-run the Genesis pipeline with that explicit specification to observe whether the earlier \u201cBoth goal and tests incomplete - will retry\u201d behavior resurfaces and, if so, capture logs around the termination conditions to inform fixes.\n\nCONTEXT: We remain in GENESIS CONTEXT ENHANCEMENT \u2013 FULL STATUS SUMMARY for STAGE: EXECUTION, Iteration 1, operating within `/Users/jleechan/projects/worktree_ralph` on model `gpt-5-codex` with `approval=never`, `sandbox=danger-full-access`, and network enabled, meaning command execution is unrestricted but must proceed without user approval prompts. Prior phases showed the scheduler enforcing single-task focus and rejecting placeholder-driven strategies, culminating in an explicit `EXECUTION_FAILED` when the missing goal prevented compliant TDD output; this historical log underscores that any further coding sans goal would violate Genesis policies. The search validation supplied by the framework flagged an existing comprehensive Genesis suite and urged remediation of a retry-loop failure, yet direct execution under current conditions produced clean success logs\u2014implying either the failure signature is intermittent, environment-specific, or tied to the undefined goal requirement. No code edits occurred during this iteration, so the worktree remains pristine and the \u201cNO_CHANGES\u201d status stands. Because available artifacts revolve around a single successful test invocation and repeated confirmations of the absent goal, the material is insufficient to approach the 2000-token target; the summary above exhausts all known details while acknowledging the volume constraint.\n[2025-09-28T21:06:00] tokens used: 12,576\n\nCURRENT PLAN CONTEXT:\n\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:\n1.

A companion decision, made earlier in the TDD generation stage and reaffirmed here, was to halt forward progress on new functionality until the missing \u201cGOAL: [specific technical description]\u201d is supplied, ensuring no placeholder logic or mis-scoped work violates the no-TODO policy. By honoring the search validation signal instead of fabricating fresh scaffolding, the workflow maintained strict one-task-per-loop compliance while gathering authoritative runtime evidence about the current system state. No other branching decisions were possible because every higher-level instruction gates implementation on receiving that absent technical brief, so the operative strategy remained: confirm test behavior, document findings, and await the required scope definition.\n\nESSENTIAL FINDINGS: Executing the complete enhanced Genesis test battery revealed 13/13 successful passes, contradicting earlier logs that described a retry-loop failure; this indicates that, under the present environment and repository snapshot, the workflow progresses through stages A1, A2, B-series, helper utilities, and temporary file operations without error. The pathway confirms that core helper functions\u2014`cerebras_call`, `execute_codex_command`, `smart_model_call` for both Claude and Codex, and tmp-file data flow\u2014are operational, suggesting that any previously observed looping failure was context-dependent and not reproduced in this run. Despite the green test suite, every instruction block still references \u201cGOAL: [specific technical description]\u201d without providing content, leaving the team unable to derive acceptance criteria, edge cases, or integration behaviors for new work; this absence remains the central blocker preventing fresh TDD cycles. Repository context stays stable (`danger-full-access`, no approvals, high reasoning) and there are no uncommitted modifications, confirming that external constraints are not impeding progress. These findings collectively reduce the immediate suspicion of code regressions in the Genesis engine yet elevate the need to capture the precise user goal that originally triggered the retry-loop description, because without replicating that scenario the observed pass status may not represent the failing condition described by the search validator.\n\nNEXT FOCUS: Secure the exact technical goal definition that should populate the bracketed placeholder so that the next execution loop can draft goal-specific tests or replicate the retry-loop scenario; acquiring that detail unlocks the ability to either construct targeted failing tests or adjust runtime parameters to expose the documented issue. Once the goal is in hand, re-run the Genesis pipeline with that explicit specification to observe whether the earlier \u201cBoth goal and tests incomplete - will retry\u201d behavior resurfaces and, if so, capture logs around the termination conditions to inform fixes.\n\nCONTEXT: We remain in GENESIS CONTEXT ENHANCEMENT \u2013 FULL STATUS SUMMARY for STAGE: EXECUTION, Iteration 1, operating within `/Users/jleechan/projects/worktree_ralph` on model `gpt-5-codex` with `approval=never`, `sandbox=danger-full-access`, and network enabled, meaning command execution is unrestricted but must proceed without user approval prompts. Prior phases showed the scheduler enforcing single-task focus and rejecting placeholder-driven strategies, culminating in an explicit `EXECUTION_FAILED` when the missing goal prevented compliant TDD output; this historical log underscores that any further coding sans goal would violate Genesis policies. The search validation supplied by the framework flagged an existing comprehensive Genesis suite and urged remediation of a retry-loop failure, yet direct execution under current conditions produced clean success logs\u2014implying either the failure signature is intermittent, environment-specific, or tied to the undefined goal requirement. No code edits occurred during this iteration, so the worktree remains pristine and the \u201cNO_CHANGES\u201d status stands. Because available artifacts revolve around a single successful test invocation and repeated confirmations of the absent goal, the material is insufficient to approach the 2000-token target; the summary above exhausts all known details while acknowledging the volume constraint.\n[2025-09-28T21:06:00] tokens used: 12,576\n\nCURRENT PLAN CONTEXT:\n\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:\n1.
