        self.embedding_model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
        self.hybrid_retriever = HybridRetriever()

    def index_game_entity(self, entity_type, entity_data):
        # Create semantic embedding
        embedding = self.embedding_model.encode(
            f"{entity_data['description']} {entity_data['current_state']}"
        )

        # Store with rich metadata

                }
            }]
        )

    def retrieve_contextual_entities(self, current_scene, max_entities=10):
        # Hybrid TF-IDF + semantic retrieval
        semantic_results = self.semantic_search(current_scene)
        keyword_results = self.keyword_search(current_scene)

        # Merge and rank results

        self.personality_analyzer = PersonalityAnalyzer()
        self.causality_tracker = CausalityChain()
        self.state_predictor = StatePredictor()

    def predict_interaction_outcomes(self, proposed_action, lookahead_steps=3):
        current_state = self.get_world_state()
        predictions = []

        for step in range(lookahead_steps):
            # Predict character responses based on MBTI profiles
            character_responses = self.personality_analyzer.predict_responses(
                current_state.active_characters,
                proposed_action
            )

            # Analyze causal chains
            causal_effects = self.causality_tracker.predict_effects(
                character_responses,
                current_state
            )

            # Check for potential conflicts
            conflicts = self.detect_future_conflicts(causal_effects)

            if conflicts:
                return ConflictPrediction(
                    step=step,
                    conflicts=conflicts,
                    prevention_strategies=self.generate_alternatives(conflicts)
                )

            # Update state for next prediction step
            current_state = self.state_predictor.apply_effects(
                current_state, causal_effects
            )

        return ConflictPrediction(safe_to_proceed=True)
```


### Token Optimization Strategy

Given your **300k+ tokens per interaction** usage pattern, implement aggressive optimization:

#### **Smart Context Assembly**

```python
def optimize_context_for_high_volume(full_context, max_tokens=50000):
    """Optimize for 300k+ token scenarios with 60-80% reduction"""

    # Current scene (20% of tokens) - highest priority
    current_scene = extract_immediate_context(full_context, max_tokens * 0.2)

    # Essential character states (30% of tokens) - compressed representations
    character_data = compress_character_states(
        get_active_characters(full_context),
        max_tokens * 0.3
    )

    # Relevant memories via vector retrieval (40% of tokens)
    relevant_memories = vector_retrieve_contextual_memories(
        current_scene,
        max_tokens * 0.4
    )

    # World state snapshot (10% of tokens) - symbolic representation
    world_state = create_symbolic_world_state(
        get_current_location(full_context),
        max_tokens * 0.1
    )

    return SmartContext(
        immediate=current_scene,
        characters=character_data,
        memories=relevant_memories,
        world=world_state
    )
```


#### **Expected Token Reduction Results**

        # Real-time cost tracking
        current_cost = self.cost_tracker.calculate_monthly_spend(user_id)

        # Optimization suggestions
        if current_cost > user_preferences.budget_limit:
            suggestions = self.usage_optimizer.generate_savings_suggestions(
                user_id, usage_data
            )
            return CostOptimizationReport(

            total_tokens=usage_data.total_tokens,
            cost_breakdown={
                'gemini_2_5_flash': usage_data.premium_cost,
                'gpt_4_1_mini': usage_data.standard_cost,
                'gemini_lite': usage_data.budget_cost
            },
            optimization_opportunities=self.identify_savings(usage_data),
            projected_monthly_cost=self.project_monthly_spend(usage_data),
            cost_per_interaction=usage_data.total_cost / usage_data.interactions
        )
