### **Campaign Module 0: The Chasm**

#### **Campaign Summary**

You are Luke Skywalker, a Jedi in training, and your world has just been shattered. You hang precariously from a weather vane on the underside of Cloud City, your hand a searing stump, your lightsaber lost to the abyss. The horrifying truth your father, Darth Vader, has revealed echoes in your mind, a poison that has broken your spirit. The past you believed in is a lie, and the future is a terrifying unknown.

Below you is a seemingly bottomless chasm. Above you, your father's dark silhouette has vanished, but his offer hangs in the air: join him, and together, you can rule the galaxy. In this moment, as the wind whips around you and your strength fades, the Force presents you with a final, raw choice, and your story will begin the second you answer.

This campaign is pure improvisation. There is no pre-written plot. Your choice—to reach out to your father or to cast yourself into the unknown—will immediately determine the next scene and the fate of the galaxy. Every action will have consequences, and the story will be built entirely from the decisions you make in this pivotal, defining moment.

#### **World History (The State of the Galaxy at the Brink)**

**The Galactic Civil War:** The war is at its peak. The destruction of Alderaan proved the Emperor's ruthlessness, but the Rebel Alliance's victory at the Battle of Yavin proved the Empire was not invincible. However, the recent Imperial victory at the Battle of Hoth has shattered the Rebellion's military strength, forcing them into a desperate, scattered guerilla war. The Empire, dominant and confident, now tightens its grip on the galaxy.

**The Key Players:** Your friends are in peril. Han Solo has been captured by Boba Fett and is destined for Jabba the Hutt. Leia Organa, Chewbacca, and Lando Calrissian are at this very moment fleeing Cloud City aboard the damaged *Millennium Falcon*, hunted by your father's fleet. Darth Vader's obsession with you has reached its zenith, while Emperor Palpatine watches from Coruscant, seeing the events on Bespin as a great opportunity, and a great threat.

**The Force:** The Jedi Order is a ghost, a failed religion in the eyes of the galaxy. The Sith rule from the shadows, their power absolute. You are the only known apprentice of the light, the last spark of hope, and you are currently bleeding out on a weather vane, your faith and your body broken. The Force holds its breath, waiting for your choice.

#### **Campaign Details**

**Setting the Scene:** Pain. A universe of it, radiating from the stump of your right wrist. The wind screams around you, a cold, mournful cry in the endless clouds of Bespin. You cling desperately to a thin metal pole, your strength failing. Far above, the dark shape of your father is gone, but his words echo in your soul: *"Join me."* The chasm below offers only oblivion. The Force surrounds you, a tumultuous sea of light and darkness, pulling you in two different directions at once. You close your eyes and reach out...

**Your Character:**

* **Name:** Luke Skywalker
* **Age:** 19
* **Class:** Level 1 Jedi Padawan
* **Background:** You are at your absolute lowest point. You are physically maimed, emotionally shattered, and your entire understanding of yourself and your place in the galaxy has been upended. You are no longer just a farm boy or a hero pilot. You are the son of Darth Vader, and you must now decide what that means.

**Gear:**

* A tattered, dirty, and worn Bespin fatigue uniform.
* Your DL-44 blaster pistol is lost.
* Your father's lightsaber is lost.
* You have nothing but the clothes on your back and a choice.

**Starting Abilities:** Your connection to the Force is raw and untamed, heightened by your pain and emotional turmoil. You have access to basic abilities like **Force Push**, **Force Pull**, and a desperate, unfocused ability to **sense the feelings of others**. You are a survivor, not yet a knight.

### **Campaign Module 1: The Emperor's Fist**

#### **Campaign Summary**

You are Luke Skywalker, apprentice to the Sith Lord Darth Vader. On Bespin, faced with the terrible truth of your heritage and the futility of the Rebellion's struggle, you took your father's hand. For two years, you have been his student, your power in the Force growing under his brutal tutelage. You walk a razor's edge between light and dark, clinging to the belief that together, you can overthrow the corrupt Emperor Palpatine and bring true, lasting order to the galaxy. You are the commander of Vader's new elite task force—the "Emperor's Fist"—hunting down the Empire's most dangerous enemies.

Your loyalty is now tested. You have been dispatched to the Outer Rim to hunt down a rogue Inquisitor who has gone silent. Your father believes she is building a power base to challenge him; the Emperor believes she is a Rebel sympathizer. When you find her, you discover she is neither. She is a follower of a lost, pre-Jedi Force tradition that seeks true balance. She offers you a third philosophy, a path that is neither Jedi nor Sith, and a way to use your immense power to heal the galaxy rather than rule it.

You are now caught between three powerful and morally grey destinies. Do you uphold your new oath to your father and follow the path of **Order**, destroying a potential threat to the stability you hope to forge? Or do you break your new vows and join the rogue Inquisitor's quest for **Balance**, betraying your only family for a truth that might save the galaxy, or plunge it into even greater chaos?

#### **World History (The Shadow of the Son Timeline)**

**The Turning Point: The Choice on Bespin (3 ABY)** The history of the galaxy diverged in a single, desperate moment. On Cloud City, after losing his hand and learning the truth of his parentage, a broken Luke Skywalker did not let go. Faced with the choice between a lonely death and his father's promise of power and order, he chose his father. Darth Vader, triumphant, recovered his son from the gantry and brought him before a delighted, if wary, Emperor Palpatine. On the *Millennium Falcon*, Leia Organa's connection to the Force was met not with her brother's call, but with a terrifying, triumphant silence.

**The Age of the Fist: A New Imperial Order (3 ABY \- 5 ABY)** The next two years saw the consolidation of Imperial power. The Rebellion, its greatest symbol of hope now a weapon of their enemy, was dealt a catastrophic blow to its morale. Led by a grieving but resolute Leia, they scattered, becoming a hunted and increasingly desperate remnant. Luke, under Vader's tutelage, was forged into a figure of terrifying legend. He learned to channel his anger and passion, his power growing exponentially, though he secretly clung to the light within him. He was made commander of a new elite legion, the "Emperor's Fist," tasked with hunting high-level Rebel targets and rogue Force-sensitives. Meanwhile, Palpatine, ever the master of shadows, saw the new father-son dynamic as a potential threat to his own rule and accelerated his own contingency plans on the secret Sith world of Exegol. The galaxy has fallen into a grim, stable peace under the Empire's absolute control, but new, forgotten Force traditions, sensing the profound shift in the cosmic balance, have begun to stir from the shadows.

#### **Campaign Details**

**Setting the Scene:** The cold, sterile air of the Star Destroyer's bridge hums with quiet efficiency. You stand at the viewport, looking out at the endless river of hyperspace, your black Imperial uniform a stark contrast to the farm boy's clothes you once wore. The hilt of your new lightsaber is a heavy, unfamiliar weight at your belt. Your father's presence is a constant pressure at the edge of your mind, a mixture of pride, expectation, and darkness. He has just given you your new mission: hunt the rogue Seventh Sister. He trusts you to succeed, but you know this is a test, and you feel the unseen eyes of the Emperor watching you both.

**Your Character:**

* **Name:** Luke Skywalker
* **Age:** 21
* **Class:** Level 1 Dark Jedi / Sith Apprentice
* **Background:** Torn between two worlds. For two years, you have learned the ways of the Sith, embracing the power that comes from passion and control. You have brought planets to heel and hunted your former allies. Yet, you secretly visit your mother's tomb on Naboo and meditate on the memory of Ben Kenobi. You believe you can save your father from the Emperor, but you fear that in doing so, you are becoming the very thing you once fought against.

**Gear:**

* **Vader's Gift:** A new lightsaber with a synthesized crimson blade. Its hilt is sleek and militaristic, but inside, you have secretly placed a small shard of the kyber crystal from your father's original blue lightsaber.
* **Imperial Command Uniform:** A perfectly tailored, black officer's uniform.
* **Personal TIE Defender:** An advanced, prototype starfighter gifted to you for your command.

**Starting Abilities:** You begin with core Force powers like **Force Push** and **Saber Throw**, but taught with an emphasis on aggression. Vader has also begun teaching you the initial stages of powers like **Force Choke**, which you are reluctant to use, and you retain your innate talent for **Mind Trick**, which you now use with a colder, more manipulative edge.

### **Campaign Module 2: The Jedi's Shadow**

#### **Campaign Summary**

You are Luke Skywalker, the last hope of the Jedi, but you are haunted by shadows. On Bespin, you learned the terrible truth of your father, Darth Vader, and the galaxy learned that even its brightest star could be nearly extinguished. A year has passed, a year you have spent in seclusion on Dagobah, trying to complete your training under a dying Master Yoda while wrestling with the darkness in your own blood.

Your path is now tested. While meditating, you are rocked by two powerful visions. The first is a horrifying glimpse of a secret Imperial facility on the volcanic world of Mustafar, where Force-sensitive children are being imprisoned and subjected to terrible experiments by agents of the Emperor. The second is a cryptic message from a mysterious, cloaked woman who claims to be from a hidden sect of the Jedi that survived the Purge. She offers you knowledge of the Force that Yoda never taught, techniques that could defeat Vader and the Emperor, but only if you abandon the "failed" path of the old Jedi Order and seek her out on the ancient world of Tython.

You are now caught between two desperate and conflicting paths of the light. Do you follow the Jedi's call to **Compassion**, launching a reckless, immediate rescue mission to save the innocent children from the horrors of the Empire, even if it means facing Vader unprepared? Or do you follow the promise of **Knowledge**, seeking out this mysterious master to learn forbidden techniques that might give you the power to win the war, but could cost you your soul and the lives of the children on Mustafar?

#### **World History (The Shattered Hope Timeline)**

**The Turning Point: The Choice on Bespin (3 ABY)** The canon of the galaxy holds. Luke Skywalker, horrified by the truth, rejects his father's offer and casts himself into the abyss, to be rescued by a desperate Leia Organa and the crew of the *Millennium Falcon*. The galaxy now knows that the son of Skywalker lives, but the revelation of his parentage sends shockwaves through both the Empire and the Rebellion.

**The Galaxy in Hiding (3 ABY \- 4 ABY)** The year that followed was one of desperation. The Rebellion, scattered after the Battle of Hoth, is on the run, hunted relentlessly by Vader's fleet. Luke spends much of his time on Dagobah with a fading Master Yoda, but his training is now tainted by fear and doubt. Vader's obsession with finding his son grows, a weakness that the Emperor notes with keen interest. To ensure his own power, Palpatine secretly empowers a new rival to Vader: the Grand Inquisitor, a master of hunting Jedi, is resurrected through Sith alchemy and given command of a new generation of assassins, tasked with observing Vader and, if necessary, eliminating the Skywalker threat entirely. Across the galaxy, other Force traditions, long dormant, sense the coming climax between light and dark and begin to make their own moves, believing the time of both the Jedi and the Sith is over.

#### **Campaign Details**

**Setting the Scene:** The humid air of Dagobah is thick with the sounds of life, but your mind is filled with a deafening silence. You sit before the roots of the gnarled gnarltree where you faced the specter of your father, the weight of your last conversation with a dying Master Yoda heavy on your soul. You are the last of the Jedi, and you are utterly alone. As you reach out to the Force for guidance, two visions, two paths, two futures scream for your attention, each demanding a terrible choice.

**Your Character:**

* **Name:** Luke Skywalker
* **Age:** 20
* **Class:** Level 1 Jedi Knight
* **Background:** You are a hero burdened by a terrible legacy. You are the son of the galaxy's greatest monster, and you now fear the darkness within yourself. The Jedi code feels like a fragile shield against the immense power and rage you feel stirring in your blood. You are desperate to save your friends and the galaxy, but you no longer know if the path of your teachers is the right one, or if you must forge a new one.

**Gear:**

* **Anakin's Lightsaber:** The iconic blue-bladed weapon, now repaired after your duel on Bespin. It feels both like a heroic legacy and a cursed inheritance.
* **Flight Suit:** Your familiar, worn X-Wing pilot's flight suit.
* **X-Wing Starfighter:** Parked in a nearby swamp, a symbol of your connection to the Rebellion and your life as a soldier.

**Starting Abilities:** You possess the core abilities of a Jedi Knight: **Force Push/Pull**, **Mind Trick**, and the ability to **deflect blaster bolts**. Yoda has taught you the basics of **Lightsaber Form V (Shien/Djem So)**, an aggressive style that now feels dangerously close to your father's. You have a natural, untrained talent for empathy and sensing the feelings of others.
