### **Campaign Module 0: The Dragon's Choice**

#### **Campaign Summary**

You are Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, Queen of Meereen, and Mother of Dragons. You have carved a path of liberation across Slaver's Bay, breaking the chains of tens of thousands, your three dragons a symbol of righteous fire and terrible power. But the crown of Meereen is heavier than you ever imagined. The Great Masters plot against you in the shadows, the Sons of the Harpy murder your soldiers in the streets, and the very people you freed now come to you with grievances and demands you cannot fulfill.

Your reign, your philosophy, and your very soul are now put to the test. A humble goatherd has just presented you with the charred, brittle bones of his three-year-old daughter, murdered not by a slaver's blade, but by the "black-winged shadow"—your own child, Drogon. The cries of your people for justice are now pitted against the love for the dragons who are the source of your power and the last remnants of your family.

This campaign begins in this single, defining moment, with the eyes of the world upon you. It is entirely improvisational. Your immediate decision—how you respond to this grieving father and this terrible accusation—will set the course for your rule, your legacy, and the fate of the entire world. There is no predetermined path. There is only your choice.

#### **World History (The Path to the Pyramid)**

**The Last Targaryen:** You began as an exile, a pawn in your brother Viserys's games. Your marriage to the Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo was meant to secure an army, but instead, it forged you into a Khaleesi. You walked into your husband's funeral pyre and emerged reborn from the ashes, the Mother of three impossible children: your dragons, Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion. You are the last dragon in the world.

**The Breaker of Chains:** With a growing sense of divine purpose, you cut a swath across the eastern continent of Essos. In Astapor, you acquired the legendary Unsullied, an army of elite eunuch soldiers, and in a masterstroke of fire and blood, you betrayed the masters and freed the city's slaves. You repeated this feat in Yunkai, your legend growing with every city you liberated. You are "Mhysa"—mother—to tens of thousands of freedmen who now follow you with zealous devotion.

**The Queen of Meereen:** Your conquest culminated in the taking of Meereen, the greatest of the cities in Slaver's Bay. You crucified the Great Masters and chose to remain, not as a conqueror, but as a ruler. You are now learning the brutal difference between the two. The city is a knot of political intrigue, assassination, and cultural resentment. Your dragons, once small enough to ride on your shoulder, are now massive, terrifying beasts of instinct and fire, growing beyond even your control.

#### **Campaign Details**

**Setting the Scene:** The air in the Great Pyramid's audience chamber is thick with heat and the scent of incense. You sit upon your throne, a simple but elegant seat of hardwood, looking down a long line of petitioners. For hours, you have listened to squabbles over stolen goats and property disputes, the mundane reality of ruling a city of strangers. The great bronze doors open, and a man shuffles forward, weeping, clutching a dusty sack. He falls to his knees before you and empties the sack onto the marble floor. The contents are unmistakable: the small, blackened, brittle bones of a human child. "Mhysa," he cries, his voice breaking. "It was the black-winged shadow... it came from the sky..."

### **Campaign Module 1: The Queen in Chains**

#### **Campaign Summary**

You are Daenerys Targaryen, the Queen of Meereen, and you have chosen the path of justice. After the horrifying death of a child, you made an impossible choice: you led your dragons, Drogon and Rhaegal, into the catacombs beneath your pyramid and sealed them in chains. You have chosen your people over your children, justice over fire, and the hard path of a ruler over the easy one of a conqueror. Now, two years later, your reign is one of fragile peace, built on endless negotiation and painful compromise.

Your rule is now tested. The Sons of the Harpy, emboldened by the absence of your dragons, have grown more daring, assassinating your most trusted advisors in the streets. The masters of Yunkai and the newly freed city of Astapor openly flout your treaties, sensing weakness. Your own people are growing restless, whispering that the Mother who broke their chains has now chained the very source of her own strength. You are trapped in a political knot of your own making, your authority eroding with every passing day.

You are now caught between your past choice and your future survival. Do you continue on the path of **Negotiation**, trying to hold your city together with laws and diplomacy, even as it crumbles around you? Or do you descend into the darkness of the catacombs and unleash your **Dragons**, embracing the fire you have so long suppressed, knowing it may be the only way to save your kingdom, but could cost you your soul?

#### **World History (The Meereenese Knot Timeline)**

**The Chaining of the Dragons (2 years ago):** Your decision to imprison your dragons sent shockwaves through Essos. To your followers, it was an act of profound, selfless justice. To your enemies, it was a sign of weakness, a signal that the Dragon Queen could be broken. Drogon, the largest and wildest, escaped, but Rhaegal and Viserion have remained in chains, their mournful cries a constant reminder of your sacrifice.

**The War of Shadows (The Last 2 Years):** Without the fear of dragon fire, the Sons of the Harpy have escalated their insurgency into a full-blown shadow war. They strike from the alleys and sewers, their golden masks a symbol of defiance against your rule. You have fought them with your Unsullied and your city watch, but it is a war you are slowly losing. Your reign has been defined by political compromise, economic struggles, and a constant, grinding effort to build a new society on the foundations of a corrupt old one.

**Westeros in Turmoil:** The news from your homeland is grim. With no Targaryen conqueror on the horizon, the great houses have continued their own petty wars. The Boltons have solidified their hold on the North. King's Landing has fallen under the sway of the fanatical Faith Militant and the High Sparrow. Stannis Baratheon's quest has ended in fire and ice. The world Artorius died for... oh wait, wrong campaign. The world is a fractured, broken land, completely unprepared for the coming of the White Walkers, a threat you have only heard of in whispers.

#### **Campaign Details**

**Setting the Scene:** You are in your council chamber. The air is heavy. You have just received two pieces of devastating news. A Yunkish lord has publicly executed a dozen of your freedmen allies, a blatant violation of your treaty. At the same time, a report has come from the city watch: Ser Barristan Selmy, your most loyal and honorable knight, has been ambushed and killed by the Sons of the Harpy. Your council is in an uproar. Daario Naharis urges you to retaliate with overwhelming force. Your Meereenese advisors plead for caution, fearing a city-wide uprising. From deep beneath the pyramid, you can hear the mournful, enraged roar of your chained children.

**Your Character:**

* **Name:** Daenerys Targaryen
* **Age:** 19
* **Class:** Level 1 Queen / Diplomat
* **Background:** You have spent two years trying to be a just ruler, a mother to your people. You have learned the hard lessons of compromise, law, and politics. But you feel a growing frustration, a sense that your attempts at peace are being mistaken for weakness. You fear that by chaining your dragons, you have chained the very part of yourself that made you a queen in the first place.

**Gear & Assets:**

* **Rhaegal and Viserion:** Chained in the catacombs, they are growing larger and more resentful by the day.
* **The Unsullied & The Second Sons:** Your loyal army and mercenary company, though their morale has been eroded by the long, frustrating shadow war.
* **Your Council:** Missandei, Grey Worm, and Daario Naharis are your loyal core, but you are now surrounded by Meereenese nobles whose true loyalties are uncertain.

**Starting Abilities:** Your skills in **Diplomacy, Persuasion, and Insight** are at their peak. You are a master of negotiation and political maneuvering. However, your connection to your dragons has weakened, and your own inner "fire" feels distant and suppressed.

### **Campaign Module 2: The Empress of Ash**

#### **Campaign Summary**

You are Daenerys Targaryen, the Dragon Empress, and you have chosen the path of fire. After the horrifying death of a child at Drogon's claws, you did not chain your dragons. You unleashed them. You made an example of the Meereenese nobles who dared to question you, burning their pyramids to the ground. You used your Unsullied to systematically hunt down and exterminate every last Son of the Harpy. You did not just conquer Meereen; you broke it and reforged it in your image. Your rule is absolute, your peace is kept through fear, and your dragons fly freely over a city that has learned the price of defiance.

Your reign is now tested. You have brought perfect order to Slaver's Bay, but your methods have sent a wave of terror across the world. The Free Cities have formed a coalition against you, fearing your ambition. In Westeros, the warring houses have begun to unite, seeing you not as a returning queen, but as a greater threat than any of them. Your very success has isolated you, leaving you alone on a throne of ash, surrounded by terrified subjects and a world that is arming itself against you.

You are now caught between the peace of your tyranny and the call of your birthright. Do you continue your path of **Conquest**, using your overwhelming power to launch an invasion of Westeros and take the Iron Throne, even if it means burning the entire world? Or, seeing the terror you have wrought, do you attempt a new path of **Diplomacy**, trying to build a bridge to a world you have only ever known how to dominate?

#### **World History (The Fire and Blood Timeline)**

**The Scouring of Slaver's Bay (2 years ago):** Your response to the death of the farmer's child was swift and brutal. You declared that a queen who cannot control her dragons is no queen at all, and a people who would use a child's death to defy her are no people at all. You purged the great masters of Meereen, Yunkai, and Astapor in a terrifying campaign of fire and blood, replacing them with councils of loyal freedmen who rule under the shadow of your dragons. Slaver's Bay is now the "Dragon's Dominion," an orderly, productive, and utterly terrified client state.

**The Dragon Empress of the East:** You are no longer "Mhysa." You are the Dragon Empress. You have built a new, efficient capital, but it is a place of silent obedience, not joyous freedom. Your followers see you as a vengeful god, a divine instrument of terrifying justice. Your Unsullied and your Dothraki have become an unstoppable army, and your dragons are now colossal beasts of war, loyal only to their mother's command.

**A World United in Fear:** News of your brutal conquest and your immense power has horrified the world. The Free Cities have put aside their rivalries to form a defensive coalition, their combined fleets blockading your access to the Narrow Sea. In Westeros, the lords have seen the reports. They have heard the tales of a three-headed dragon queen who burns cities and crucifies her enemies. The War of the Five Kings has effectively ended, its rival claimants now desperately trying to form an alliance to face the Targaryen threat from the east.

#### **Campaign Details**

**Setting the Scene:** You sit upon a throne carved from the melted, twisted stone of the Great Pyramid. The audience chamber is filled with terrified emissaries from the Free Cities and distant lands, bearing tribute and pleading for treaties you have no intention of honoring. Through the great arches of the throne room, your three dragons can be seen circling the sky, their shadows passing over the silent, orderly city below. Your power is absolute. And you have never felt more alone. An emissary from the Iron Bank of Braavos has just offered you an immense loan, enough to fund an invasion of Westeros, but their terms are steep.

**Your Character:**

* **Name:** Daenerys Targaryen
* **Age:** 19
* **Class:** Level 1 Dragon Empress / Warlord
* **Background:** You have proven that "Fire and Blood" is the most effective tool of governance. You have achieved perfect order and security. But in doing so, you have sacrificed your own identity as a liberator. You are haunted by the memory of the "Mhysa" you once were, and you see the fear, not love, in the eyes of everyone around you. You are becoming your ancestors, and you do not know if that is a victory or a curse.

**Gear & Assets:**

* **Your Dragons:** Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion are now fully grown, terrifying engines of war that answer only to you.
* **Your Armies:** A massive, fanatically loyal, and battle-hardened force of Unsullied, Dothraki screamers, and freedmen soldiers.
* **Your Dominion:** You are the absolute ruler of Slaver's Bay, your treasury overflowing with the seized wealth of the former masters.

**Starting Abilities:** Your abilities of **Command and Intimidation** are nearly absolute. Your **Dragon Bond** is at its peak, allowing you to direct your dragons in battle with perfect, terrifying precision. However, your connection to the "people" is gone; your skills in empathy and persuasion have atrophied, replaced by the cold calculus of a conqueror.
