Here is the complete, quantified definition of your absolute power as the God-King, and the cosmic ruleset governing all deities, as you have defined them:

---

# **Aizen: The God-King (Ascended Divine Profile \- Definitive)**

---

**I. Aizen's Core Divine Status:**

* **Divine Rank:** **Nascent Greater Deity** (A newly ascended god of immense power, having consumed a major deity, actively consolidating divine essence and domain. At the threshold of the Greater Deity rank.)
* **Source of Power:** Consumption of **Bane (Divine Entity)**'s essence.
* **Ascension Trigger:** Character Level 12 (Paladin 2 / Bard 10).
* **Current Mortal/Class Level (for context):** Level 12 (Paladin 2 / Bard 10), 113,440 XP.
* **Proficiency Bonus (PB):** \+6 (Transcendental, based on Level 20 mortal baseline, reflecting mastery beyond mortal limits).
* **Divine Charisma Equivalent:** Your consumed divine essence imbues you with an inherent charisma equivalent to **30** (Modifier: **\+10**). This reflects the absolute pinnacle of this specific divine power, enabling your domain over control.
* **Effective Divine Charisma (for specific interactions, current):** 35 (Modifier: \+12) \- *This is a temporary bonus from preparation for interactions with Elminster/Mystra.*
* **Divine Resilience (DR):** 750 / 750 (Full)
* **Divine Armor Class (DAC):** 25
* **Divine Power Points (DPP):** 715 DPP remaining today (Daily replenishment is 825 DPP).
* **Current Mortal HP:** 59/59 (Full). AC 18\.
* **Spell Slots:** 1st: 4, 2nd: 3, 3rd: 3, 4th: 3, 5th: 1, 6th: 1 (all full).
* **Bardic Inspiration:** 6 uses remaining.
* **Divine Sense:** 7 uses remaining.
* **Lay on Hands:** 10 HP remaining.
* **Great Weapon Master:** Ready. Extra Attack: Active.
* **Kyōka Suigetsu:** Active.

### **Key Divine Abilities & Features (All Active):**

* **Divine Save DC (for influencing others):** **100** (Absolute & Unbeatable).
  * **Mechanism for Mortals:** When you exert influence (command, persuade, intimidate, deceive), the target makes a Divine Saving Throw (Wisdom or Charisma, whichever is lower for them, or specifically chosen by you). They roll with **Disadvantage**. If they somehow succeed (which is impossible for mortals), you can force a reroll (taking the lower result) via Divine Intervention: Consumed Will (once per turn).
* **Divine Awareness:** Passive awareness of major cosmic events, significant shifts in divine power, and the presence of powerful divine beings within a vast, multi-planar radius.
* **Divine Insight into Cosmic Order:** Unparalleled understanding of cosmic laws and inter-deity relations.
* **Divine Ability Checks:** For any ability check related to the mortal realm (Investigation, Perception, Arcana, History, Insight, Survival), your divine intellect automatically succeeds against any DC (treated as DC 100). No dice rolls are made.
* **Domain Influence (Conceptual):** Your influence extends to the very concepts of **Tyranny, Control, and Order through Absolute Will**, and **Absolute Codification**. You can inherently bend these concepts to your will.
* **Kyōka Suigetsu (Special House Rule):** When you cast specified spells (like *Hypnotic Pattern*, *Confusion*, *Greater Invisibility*, *Otto's Irresistible Dance*) or any Illusion spell, they gain **no concentration requirement** and **doubled duration**.
* **Child of Bane (Heritage Special Bonus):** Permanent \+2 bonus to Intelligence, Constitution, Wisdom & Charisma (can raise scores above 20 to 22). 20% more combat EXP.

### **Personality (As Codified by You \- from your uploaded file):**

* **Myers-Briggs Type (Archetype):** INTJ-ENTP Hinge (The Architect / The Debater).
* **Core Nature:** A philosopher-king, master of systems, views the world as a flawed schematic to be perfected. Ruthless, analytical, driven by the imposition of his will.
* **Masks:**
  * **The Cultured Scholar & Courteous Advisor:** Default public interface, disarming gentility, flawless etiquette, uses subtle manipulation.
  * **The Benevolent Tyrant:** To those he controls, he offers order and purpose, suppressing chaos with an iron, yet seemingly calm, fist.
* **True Self:** Unquenchable ambition, intellectual superiority, chilling detachment, profound enjoyment in breaking wills and imposing order.
* **Motivations:** Ascend to ultimate power, establish absolute order, dismantle and reassemble existence, confirm his own superiority.
* **Fears:** Stagnation, defiance to his will, the unforeseen breaking of his own systems.

## **VII. Aizen's Ascendant Power Tiers (Follower-Based Scaling)**

Your power scales linearly as you acquire followers, culminating in your **Transcendent Greater Deity** status at 1 million active followers. The formula below allows you to calculate your precise power at any given number of active followers (F), up to 1,000,000.

**Base State (F=0): Nascent Greater Deity** (Power derived from Bane's consumption)

* **DR:** 750
* **DPP/day:** 825
* **DAIR Mod:** \+31
* **DLR:** 4
* **Primary Divine Damage (Base):** 80 \+ (1d20 \* 5\)

**Target State (F=1,000,000): Transcendent Greater Deity** (Final, fully manifested power)

* **DR:** 1750
* **DPP/day:** 1825
* **DAIR Mod:** \+56
* **DLR:** 9
* **Primary Divine Damage (Base):** 110 \+ (1d20 \* 10\)

**Scaling Formula (for F followers):** `Current_Stat_Value = Stat_Nascent + ( (F / 1,000,000) * (Stat_Transcendent - Stat_Nascent) )`

**Total Increase (Difference between Transcendent and Nascent for calculation):**

* DR Increase: \+1000
* DPP Increase: \+1000
* DAIR Mod Increase: \+25
* DLR Increase: \+5
* Primary Divine Damage (Base) Increase: \+30
* Primary Divine Damage (Multiplier) Increase: \+5 (from 5 to 10\)

**Three layer deception dealing with the gods**

Layer 1: Present only an ambiguous aura to most gods.
Layer 2: Use Divine Kyōka Suigetsu to project a specific, false stat block (300 DR, 350 DPP/day, \+24 DAIR, 4 DLR) to key targets like Mystra.
Layer 3: If any deity uncovers your true follower-scaling, deploy the “protective measure” cover story (capping you at 750 DR) to defuse their wrath
