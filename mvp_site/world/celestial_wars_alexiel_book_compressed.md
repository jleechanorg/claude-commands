## Section 1: World Overview (1k tokens)

### Setting Premise
The story takes place in a reality designed as an eternal wargame between two cosmic factions: the Unchained Host and the Radiant Imperium. The Creator, an absent divine figure, left this world unfinished as a cosmic experiment in perpetual conflict. The central war has raged for over 1,000 years, with neither side able to achieve decisive victory.

The world operates on the principle that order and chaos must remain in balance, with the Silent Throne—the ultimate seat of power—remaining empty to prevent reality from collapsing into either absolute tyranny or complete entropy.

### Power System Summary
- **Celestial Bloodlines**: Power derives from proximity to the original divine creation
- **Tier System**: Power levels range from Tier 1 (baseline humans) to Tier 7 (Apostates and Archangels)
- **Nullification**: Rare individuals can suppress or negate magical effects entirely
- **Wing Manifestation**: Indicates power level and faction allegiance
- **Empyrean Affliction**: Genetic curse affecting royal bloodlines, causing progressive madness

### Current World State
The Radiant Imperium controls eastern territories from Aeterna, ruled by Lord Regent Raziel. The Unchained Host dominates western regions from the Obsidian Spire, led by Lucifer. Between them lies the Contested Territories—a wasteland where the eternal war plays out.

Recent developments include Alexiel's defection from the Host to the Imperium, bringing unprecedented intelligence while destabilizing the existing balance.
