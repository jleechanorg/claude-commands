## Other Deleted Content
- Twin's name changed: "Valerius" was changed to "Darius" (this might be intentional correction)
- Compression Summary section removed (replaced with Rules & Restrictions)
- Names Library section number changed from 8 to 9

## Analysis
This deletion represents a significant loss of world content:
- 3 major factions completely removed (Elves, Gnomes, Dwarves)
- 2 minor faction groups removed (Halflings, Ogres)
- 1 intelligence network removed (Shadow Syndicate)
- At least 15+ named characters removed
- Multiple sub-factions and their internal conflicts removed

This violates the stated principle that "we should only be adding content from alexiel book" and the implementation note that "No content should be lost in the merge".
