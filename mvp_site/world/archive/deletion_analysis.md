## 9. Alexiel's Character Profile

## ACTUAL CONTENT DELETIONS:
After careful analysis, the ONLY actual content deletions (not replacements/enhancements) are:
1. Compression Summary section (no longer relevant)
2. Brief character descriptions that were expanded elsewhere

Everything else is reorganization, enhancement, or correction.
