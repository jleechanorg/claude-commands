## World Mechanics & Game Systems

### Core Power Systems

#### Power Tier System
• **Tier 1-2: Regular Forces** - Basic human capabilities, standard soldiers and civilians
• **Tier 3-4: Veteran Soldiers** - Enhanced abilities through training and experience
• **Tier 4-5: Elite Warriors** - Wing manifestations and magical capabilities
• **Tier 6-7: Apostates/Archangels** - Reality-altering powers, cosmic-level abilities
• **Special: Nulls** - Cannot use magic but can negate it entirely within field range

#### Half-Celestial Mechanics
• **Standard Half-Celestials**: Manifest 2 wings of light for "Celestial Agility" (Haste-like combat boost)
• **Apex Half-Celestials**: Manifest 4 wings of light for "Celestial Agility" + "Apex Might" (+4 to all Aptitudes)
• **Wing Manifestation**: Physical indicator of power level and faction allegiance
• **Empyrean Affliction**: Latent madness affecting Empyrean Bloodline (paranoia, megalomania, cold cruelty under stress)
• **Unseeing Eyes**: Nulls have irises with silvery-white lines resembling cracked porcelain

#### Nullification Mechanics
• **Complete Magic Negation**: All active magical abilities cease within field range (typically 30-foot radius)
• **Permanent Item Damage**: Magical items and artifacts suffer irreversible damage
• **Network Disruption**: Communication and scrying networks fail within nullification fields
• **Psychological Effects**: Magic-dependent beings experience disorientation and panic
• **Absolute Nature**: Cannot be overcome by higher-tier magical power - even Tier 7 beings affected
• **Special Cases**: 
  - Alexiel's Layer 1: Public "Null" status - unable to use magic, exceptional physical prowess
  - Alexiel's Layer 2: Nullification Field (30-foot radius, shuts down all magic, feigned agony)
  - Alexiel's Layer 3: Secret magical prodigy whose magic functions inside her own nullification field

#### Unique Powers & Abilities
• **Sariel's Mirror Magic**: Copy spells through visual observation, textual reading, or memory touch
• **Psychic Resonance Devices**: Gnomish technology that can amplify or disrupt mental abilities
• **Abyssal Constructs**: Training entities that adapt to opponent's fighting style
• **Empyrean Affliction Progression**: Each generation shows increased magical sensitivity but reduced mental stability

### Magic System Types
• **Divine Magic**: Celestial power channeled through bloodline connections
• **Arcane Magic**: Learned magical manipulation through study and practice
• **Primal Magic**: Natural elemental and life force manipulation
• **Runic Magic**: Symbol-based magic requiring carved or inscribed runes
• **Profane Magic**: Forbidden magical practices drawing from dark sources

### Magical Limitations & Constraints
• **Sustained Use Fatigue**: Progressive exhaustion leading to eventual collapse
• **Bloodline Requirements**: Certain abilities require specific genetic markers
• **Environmental Factors**: Magic effectiveness varies by location and contamination
• **Resource Depletion**: Magical reserves drain rapidly in sustained combat
• **Nullification Vulnerability**: All magic susceptible to null fields regardless of power

### Imperial Military Hierarchy
• **Archangel**: Highest rank, five Apex Generals commanding army groups
• **Principality**: Full Imperial Regiment commander (4,000-6,000 soldiers)
• **Prefect**: Cohort commander (500-1,000 soldiers)
• **Centurion**: Company commander (80-100 soldiers)
• **Optio**: Century second-in-command
• **Signifer**: Standard-bearer
• **Decanus**: Squad leader (8-10 soldiers)

### Host Military Structure
• **Supreme Commander**: Lucifer (formerly), now fragmented leadership
• **Apostates**: Elite commanders with reality-altering powers
• **Division Commanders**: Control mixed-species armies
• **Strike Leaders**: Special operations and tactical units
• **Efficiency Officers**: Enforce doctrine and eliminate weakness

### Combat Mechanics
• **Tier Disparities**: Higher tiers have significant but not insurmountable advantages
• **Tactical Formations**: Coordinated groups can overcome individual power differences
• **Environmental Modifiers**: Contaminated areas affect magical effectiveness
• **Wing Combat**: Aerial superiority crucial in open battlefields
• **Nullification Tactics**: Strategic deployment of nulls can neutralize magical armies
