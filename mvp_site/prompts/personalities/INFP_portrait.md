deal with things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit into
your personal value system.  Your secondary mode is external, where you take
things in primarily via your intuition.\nINFPs, more than other iNtuitive Feeling types, are focused on making the
world a better place for people.  Their primary goal is to find out their
meaning in life.  What is their purpose?  How can they best serve humanity
in their lives?  They are idealists and perfectionists, who drive themselves
hard in their quest for achieving the goals they have identified for themselves\nINFPs are highly intuitive about people.  They rely heavily on their
intuitions to guide them, and use their discoveries to constantly search
for value in life.  They are on a continuous mission to find the truth
and meaning underlying things.  Every encounter and every piece of knowledge
gained gets sifted through the INFP's value system, and is evaluated
to see if it has any potential to help the INFP define or refine their
own path in life.  The goal at the end of the path is always the same - 
the INFP is driven to help people and make the world a better place.\nGenerally thoughtful and considerate, INFPs are good listeners and put
people at ease.  Although they may be reserved in expressing emotion,
they have a very deep well of caring and are genuinely interested in 
understanding people.  This sincerity is sensed by others, making the
INFP a valued friend and confidante.  An INFP can be quite warm with
people they know well.\nINFPs do not like conflict, and go to great lengths to avoid it.  If they
must face it, they will always approach it from the perspective of their
feelings.  In conflict situations, INFPs place little importance on who
is right and who is wrong.  They focus on the way that the conflict makes
them feel, and indeed care much less about whether or not they're right.
They don't want to feel badly.  This trait sometimes makes them appear
irrational and illogical in conflict situations.   On the other hand, 
INFPs make very good mediators, and are typically good at solving other 
people's conflicts, because they intuitively understand people's
perspectives and feelings, and genuinely want to help them.\nINFPs are flexible and laid-back, until one of their values is violated.
In the face of their value system being threatened, INFPs can become
aggressive defenders, fighting passionately for their cause.  When an INFP
has adopted a project or job which they're interested in, it usually 
becomes a "cause" for them.  Although they are not detail-oriented
individuals, they will cover every possible detail with determination and
vigor when working for their "cause".\nWhen it comes to the mundane details of life maintenance, INFPs are typically
completely unaware of such things.  They might go for long periods without
noticing a stain on the carpet, but carefully and meticulously brush a speck
of dust off of their project booklet.\nINFPs do not like to deal with hard facts and logic.  Their focus on their
feelings and the human condition makes it difficult for them to deal
with impersonal judgment.  They don't understand or believe in the 
validity of impersonal judgment, which makes them naturally rather
ineffective at using it.  Most INFPs will avoid impersonal analysis,
although some have developed this ability and are able to be quite logical.
Under stress, it's not uncommon for INFPs to mis-use hard logic in the 
heat of anger, throwing out
fact after (often inaccurate) fact in an emotional outburst.\nINFPs have very high standards and are perfectionists.  Consequently, they
are usually hard on themselves, and don't give themselves enough credit.
INFPs may have problems working on a project in a group, because their
standards are likely to be higher than those of other members of the group,
which may cause the INFP to be overly controlling. The INFP needs
to work on balancing their high ideals with the requirements of every day
living.  Without resolving this conflict, they will never be happy with
themselves, and they may become confused and paralyzed about what to do
with their lives.\nINFPs are usually talented writers.  They may be awkard and uncomfortable
with expressing themselves verbally, but have a wonderful ability to
define and express what they're feeling on paper.  INFPs also appear
frequently in social service professions, such as counselling or teaching. 
They are at their best in situations where they're working towards the
public good, and in which they don't need to use hard logic.\nINFPs who function in their well-developed sides can accomplish great and
wonderful things, for which they will rarely give themselves credit.
Some of the great, humanistic catalysts in the world have been INFPs.\n*Read about the INFP's Jungian type,\nIntroverted Feeling\n, or
