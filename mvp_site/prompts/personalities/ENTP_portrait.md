take things in primarily via your intuition.  Your secondary mode is internal,
where you deal with things rationally and logically.\nWith Extraverted Intuition dominating their personality, the ENTP's
primary interest in life is understanding the world and sussing out
possibilities in it.
They are constantly absorbing ideas and images about the situations they
are presented in their lives.  Using their intuition to process this
information, they are usually extremely quick and accurate in their
ability to size up a situation.  With the exception of their ENFP
cousin, the ENTP has a deeper understanding of their environment
than any of the other types.\nThis ability to intuitively understand people and situations puts
the ENTP at a distinct advantage in their lives.  They generally
understand things quickly and with great depth.  Accordingly, they
are quite flexible and adapt well to a wide range of tasks.
They are good at most anything that interests them.  As they grow
and further develop their intuitive abilities and insights, they 
become very aware that exciting possibilities exist all around them.\nENTPs are idea people.  Their perceptive abilities cause them to
see possibilities everywhere.  They get excited and enthusiastic
about their ideas, and are able to spread their enthusiasm to 
others.  In this way, they get the support that they need to 
fulfill their visions.\nENTPs are less interested in developing plans of actions or making
decisions than they are in generating possibilities and ideas.
Following through on the implementation of an idea is usually a chore
to the ENTP.  For some ENTPs, this results in the habit of never
finishing what they start.  The ENTP who has not developed their
Thinking process will have problems with jumping enthusiastically
from idea to idea, without following through on their plans.  The
ENTP needs to take care to think through their ideas fully in order
to take advantage of them.\nThe ENTP's auxiliary process of Introverted Thinking
drives their decision making process.  Although the ENTP is more
interested in absorbing information than in making decisions,
they are quite rational and logical in reaching conclusions.
When they apply Thinking to their Intuitive perceptions, the
outcome can be very powerful indeed.  A well-developed
ENTP is extremely visionary, inventive, and enterprising in their quest for uncovering
truth in the world around them.\nENTPs are fluent conversationalists, mentally quick, and enjoy verbal sparring
with others.  They love to debate issues, and may even switch sides sometimes
just for the love of the debate.  When they express their underlying principles,
however, they may feel awkward and speak abruptly and intensely.\nThe ENTP personality type is sometimes referred to the "lawyer type,"
that quickly and accurately understands a situation, and 
objectively and logically acts upon it using their auxilliary Introverted Thinking
function.  
If an ENTP lawyer is tasked with  defending someone who
committed a crime, they might take advantage of quirks in
the law to get their client off the hook.  If they were to
actually win the case, they would see their actions as completely fair
and proper to the situation, because their actions were lawful—the
guilt or innocence of their client would be less relevant.  If this
type of reasoning goes uncompletely unchecked by the ENTP, it could
result in a character that is perceived by others as unethical or
dishonest. The ENTP, who does not naturally consider the
personal, human element in decision making, should take care
to notice the subjective side of situations.  This is
a potential problem are for ENTPs. Although their logical abilities
lend strength and purpose to the ENTP, they may also isolate the ENTP from
their feelings, and from the social empathy of the culture in which they live.\nThe least developed area for the ENTP is Sensing. An ENTP may struggle
with taking care of the details of their life.
Conversely, under stress, the ENTP may lose their ability to generate possibilities,
and become obsessed with minor details. These details may seem to be
extremely important to the ENTP, but usually aren't. When the stress fades,
the obsession with details will fade as well.\nIn general, ENTPs are upbeat visionaries.  They highly value knowledge,
and spend much of their lives seeking a higher understanding.
They live in the world of possibilities,
and become excited about concepts, challenges and difficulties.  When
presented with a problem, they're good at improvising and quickly come
up with a creative solution.  Creative, clever, fun,
curious, and theoretical, ENTPs have a broad range of possibilities in 
their lives.\n*Read about the ENTP's Jungian type,\nExtraverted Intuition\n, or
