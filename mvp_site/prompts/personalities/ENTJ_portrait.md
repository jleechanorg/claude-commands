deal with things rationally and logically.  Your secondary mode
is internal, where you take things in primarily via your intuition.\nENTJs are natural born leaders.  They live in a world of possibilities where they see all
sorts challenges to be surmounted, and they want to be the ones responsible
for surmounting them.  They have a drive for leadership that is well-served
by their quickness to grasp complexities, their ability to absorb a large
amount of impersonal information, and their quick and decisive judgments.
They are "take charge" people.\nENTJs are very career-focused, and fit into the corporate world quite
naturally.  They are constantly scanning their environment for potential
problems that they can turn into solutions.  They generally see things
from a long-range perspective, and are usually successful at identifying
plans to turn problems around - especially problems of a corporate nature.
ENTJs are usually successful in the business world, because they are so
driven to leadership.  They're tireless in their efforts on the job, and
driven to visualize where an organization is headed.  For these reasons,
they are natural corporate leaders.\nThere is not much room for error in the world of the ENTJ.  They dislike to
see mistakes repeated, and have no patience with inefficiency.  They may
become quite harsh when their patience is tried in these respects, because
they are not naturally tuned in to people's feelings, and more than likely
don't believe that they should tailor their judgments in consideration
for people's feelings.  ENTJs, like many types,  have difficulty seeing 
things from outside their own perspective.  
Unlike other types, ENTJs naturally have little patience with people who do not
see things the same way as the ENTJ.
The ENTJ needs to consciously work on recognizing the value of other
people's opinions, as well as the value of being sensitive towards
people's feelings.  In the absence of this awareness, the ENTJ will
be a forceful, intimidating and overbearing individual.  This may
be a real problem for the ENTJ, who may be deprived of important information
and collaboration from others.  In their personal world, it can make
some ENTJs overbearing as spouses or parents.\nThe ENTJ has a tremendous amount of personal power and presence that
will work for them as a force towards achieving their goals.  However,
this personal power is also an agent of alienation and self-aggrandizement,
that the ENTJ would do well to avoid.\nENTJs are very forceful, decisive individuals.  
They make decisions quickly, and are
quick to verbalize their opinions and decisions to the rest of the world.
The ENTJ who has not developed their Intuition will make decisions too hastily, 
without understanding all of the issues and possible solutions.  On the other hand,
an ENTJ who has not developed their Thinking side will have difficulty
applying logic to their insights, and will often make poor decisions.
In that case, they may have brilliant ideas and insight into situations,
but they may have little skill at determining how to act upon their 
understanding, or their actions may be inconsistent.
An ENTJ who has developed in a generally
less than ideal way may become dictatorial and abrasive - intrusively 
giving orders and direction without a sound reason for doing so, and
without consideration for the people involved.\nAlthough ENTJs are not naturally tuned into other people's feelings,
these individuals frequently have very strong sentimental streaks.
Often these sentiments are very powerful to the ENTJ, although they will
likely hide it from general knowledge, believing the feelings to be
a weakness.  Because the world of feelings and values is not where the
ENTJ naturally functions, they may sometimes make value judgments and
hold onto submerged emotions that are ill-founded and inappropriate, and
will cause them problems - sometimes rather serious problems.\nENTJs love to interact with people.  
As Extroverts, they're energized and stimulated primarily externally.
There's nothing more enjoyable and satisfying to the ENTJ than having
a lively, challenging conversation.  They especially respect people
who are able to stand up to the ENTJ, and argue persuasively for their point
of view.  There aren't too many people who will do so, however, because the
ENTJ is a very forceful and dynamic presence who has a tremendous amount
of self-confidence and excellent verbal communication skills.
Even the most confident individuals may experience moments of self-doubt
when debating a point with an ENTJ.\nENTJs want their home to be beautiful, well-furnished, and efficiently run. 
They're likely to place much emphasis on their children being well-educated
and structured, to desire a congenial and devoted relationship with their
spouse.  At home, the ENTJ needs to be in charge as much as they do at
their work place.  The ENTJ is likely best paired with someone who has a strong
self-image, who is also a Thinking type.  Because the ENTJ is primarily
focused on their careers, some ENTJs have a problem with
being constantly absent from home, physically or mentally.\nThe ENTJ has many gifts that make it possible for them to have a great deal
of personal power, if they don't forget to remain balanced in their lives.
They are assertive, innovative, long-range thinkers with an excellent ability 
to translate theories and possibilities into solid plans of action.  They
are usually tremendously forceful personalities, and have the tools to
accomplish whatever goals they set out for.\n*Read about the ENTJ's Jungian type,\nExtraverted Thinking\n, or
