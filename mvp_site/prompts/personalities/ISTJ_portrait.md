you take things in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion.
Your secondary mode is external, where you deal with things rationally
and logically.\nISTJs are quiet and reserved individuals who are interested in security
and peaceful living.  They have a strongly-felt internal sense of duty,
which lends them a serious air and the motivation to follow through on
tasks.  Organized and methodical in their approach, they can
generally succeed at any task they undertake.\nISTJs are very loyal, faithful, and dependable.  They place great
importance on honesty and integrity.  They are "good citizens" who
can be depended on to do the right thing for their families and
communities.  While they generally take things very seriously, they
also usually have an offbeat sense of humor and can be a lot of fun - 
especially at family or work-related gatherings.\nISTJs tend to believe in laws and traditions, and expect the same from others.
They're not comfortable with breaking laws or going against the rules.
If they are able to see a good reason for stepping outside of the
established mode of doing things, the ISTJ will support that effort.
However, ISTJs more often tend to believe that things should be done
according to procedures and plans.  If an ISTJ has not developed their
Intuitive side sufficiently, they may become overly obsessed with structure,
and insist on doing everything "by the book".\nThe ISTJ is extremely dependable on following through with things they have 
promised to do.  For this reason, they sometimes get more and more
work piled on them.  Because the ISTJ has such a strong sense of duty, they
may have a difficult time saying "no" when they are given more work than
they can reasonably handle.  For this reason, the ISTJ often works long
hours, and may be unwittingly taken advantage of.\nThe ISTJ will work for long periods of time and put tremendous amounts
of energy into doing any task that they see as important to fulfilling
a goal.  However, they will resist putting energy into things that don't
make sense to them, or for which they can't see a practical application.
They prefer to work alone, but work well in teams when the situation
demands it.  They like to be accountable for their actions, and
enjoy being in positions of authority.  The ISTJ has little use for
theory or abstract thinking, unless the practical application of the theory is clear.\nISTJs have tremendous respect for facts.
They hold a tremendous store of facts within themselves, that they
have gathered through their Sensing preference. 
They may have difficulty understanding a theory or idea that
is different from their own perspective.  However, if they are shown
the importance or relevance of the idea by someone who they respect or
care about, the idea becomes a fact, which the ISTJ will internalize
and support.  Once the ISTJ supports a cause or idea, they will
stop at no lengths to ensure that they are doing their duty of
giving support where support is needed.\nThe ISTJ is not naturally in tune with their own feelings or the feelings
of others.  They may have difficulty picking up on emotional needs
in the moment, as they are presented.  Being perfectionists themselves,
they have a tendency to take other people's efforts for granted, like they
take their own efforts for granted.  They need to remember to pat people
on the back once in a while.\nISTJs are likely to be uncomfortable
expressing affection and emotion to others.  However, their strong sense
of duty and the ability to see what needs to be done in any situation
usually allows them to overcome their natural reservations, and they
are usually quite supporting and caring individuals with the people
that they love.  Once the ISTJ
realizes the emotional needs of those who are close to them, they put 
forth effort to meet those needs.\nThe ISTJ is extremely faithful and loyal.  Traditional and family-minded,
they will put forth great amounts of effort at making their homes
and families running smoothly.  They are responsible parents, taking their
parenting roles seriously.  They are usually good and generous providers
to their families.  They care deeply about those close to them, although
they usually are not comfortable with expressing their love.
The ISTJ is likely to express their affection through actions, rather than
through words.\nISTJs have an excellent ability to take any task and define it, organize it,
plan it, and implement it through to completion.  They are very hard 
workers, who do not allow obstacles to get in the way of performing
their duties.  They do not usually give themselves enough credit for
their achievements, seeing their accomplishments simply as the natural
fulfillment of their obligations.\nISTJs usually have a great sense of space and function, and artistic
appreciation.  Their homes are likely to be tastefully furnished
and immaculately maintained.  They are acutely aware of their senses,
and want to be in surroundings that fit their need for structure,
order, and beauty.\nUnder stress, ISTJs may fall into "catastrophe mode", where they see
nothing but all of the possibilities of what could go wrong.  They 
will berate themselves for things that they should have done differently,
or duties that they failed to perform.  They will lose their ability
to see things calmly and reasonably, and will depress themselves with
their visions of doom. An ISTJ in such a state of mind might benefit by
remembering that their doomsday feelings will pass with their stress.\nIn general, the ISTJ has a tremendous amount of potential.
Capable, logical, reasonable, and effective individuals with a deeply
driven desire to promote security and peaceful living, the ISTJ has
what it takes to be highly effective at achieving their chosen goals -
whatever they may be.\n*Read about the ISTJ's Jungian type,\nIntroverted Sensing\n, or
