Heyward\nWhat does\nSuccess\nmean to an ESFJ?\nThe ESFJ is called the "Caregiver", and for good reason. Caring is the
very nature of their personality; a personality driven by feeling judgements
and supported by a strong sense of the world around them. The ESFJ not only
sees how situations affect themselves and others, they are concerned about it.
Everything that makes them feel valued and successful is bound inextricably to
the value and concern they need to exchange with others. "Give and ye shall
receive" is the motto of the ESFJ, whose gifts serve the most important
function in all communal human processes, from the family to the wider world of
care giving such as hospitality, primary teaching, nursing, aged care, social
services, human resources and so on. Whilst their judgements might be bound by
a somewhat conventional moral code, the ESFJ always stands up for what they are
certain is the best for others. In some situations this trait can lead them
into disaster, particularly if they are thrust into an unsuitable role. The
ESFJ thrives best where they can make the decisions and organise things to suit
their own way of seeing the world. Regardless however of their particular
station in life, the ESFJ is at their best when it involves caring for and
about others, measuring their success by the happiness and gratitude which is
reflected back to them from the people in whose lives they play a part.\nAllowing your ESFJ strengths to flourish\nAs an ESFJ, you have gifts that are specific to your personality type
    that aren't natural strengths for other types. By recognizing your special
    gifts and encouraging their growth and development, you will more readily see
    your place in the world, and be more content with your role.\nNearly all ESFJs will recognize the following characteristics in themselves.  They should embrace and nourish these strengths:\nA strong sense of what is right and wrong\nEasily empathises with another person\nAble to share feelings with other people\nCares greatly about the welfare of others\nOpen, honest and forthright about the way they see things\nSensitive to the needs of others, particularly those judged to be less fortunate\nStrongly upholds traditional and safe ways of living\nESFJs who have a strongly expressed Introverted Sensing function will find they also enjoy these very special gifts:\nVery sensitive to how any situation might be inwardly affecting another person\nAble to see the potential in any human environment for enabling the comfort and safety of others\nA flair for dramatic illustration and story telling which makes them excellent teachers of the young\nAble to make strong, people-oriented administrative decisions\nA skill with fashion and decoration which makes people feel good about themselves\nAble to see outside the "square" and adjust their values to the facts of a situation\nPotential problem areas\nWith any gift of strength, there is an associated weakness. Without
  "bad", there would be no "good". Without
  "difficult", there would be no "easy". We value our
  strengths, but we often curse and ignore our weaknesses. To grow as a person
  and get what we want out of life, we must not only capitalize upon our
  strengths, but also face our weaknesses and deal with them. That means taking a
  hard look at our personality type's potential problem areas.\nESFJs are kind, steady and responsible beings with many special gifts. I
would like the ESFJ to keep in mind their many positive traits as they read on,
and remember that the weaknesses associated with being an ESFJ are natural to
your type. Although it can be depressing to read about your type's weaknesses,
please remember that we offer this information to enact positive change. We
want people to grow into their own potential, and to live happy and successful
lives.\nMany of the ESFJ's weaker characteristics arise because their dominant
and Extraverted Feeling function can overshadow the rest of their personality.
This generally results in two notable effects. With their Introverted Sensing function
unable to provide sufficient balance to their sharply defined feeling
judgements, they often miss the relativities and contingencies of the real
world. This very often leads them into conflict with those who believe a
situation needs to be properly analysed before its realities can be seen and
acted upon. Secondly, with their sense of the world controlled by feelings
alone, the narrowly defined ESFJ will nearly always find themselves at odds
with any view of the world that does not see their own clearly held judgements
to be primary, or which does not accord them the "feeling toned" responses they
expect. This can produce a range of effects, every one of which ends in
conflict for the ESFJ, either with others or with their own feelings.\nWithout a sound appreciation of the concrete world, an ESFJ may show some or all of the following weaknesses in varying degrees:\nMay become spiteful and extremely intractable in the face of clear, logical reasoning\nMay be unable to shrug off feelings that others are not "good people"\nMay be unable to acknowledge anything that goes against their certainty about the "correct" or "right" way to do things\nMay attribute their own problems to arbitrary and unprovable notions about the way people "ought" to behave\nMay be at a loss when confronted with situations that require basic technical expertise or clear thinking\nMay be oblivious to all but their own viewpoint, valuing their own viewpoint, valuing their own certainties to the exclusion of others\nMay be unable to understand verbal logic, and quickly cut off other's explanations\nMay be falsely certain of the true needs and feeling of others\nMay be extremely vulnerable to superstitions, religious cults, and media manipulation\nMay react too quickly and too emotionally in a situation better dealt with in a more pragmatic fashion\nExplanation of problems\nNearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be
attributed in various degrees to the ESFJs externally mapped, feeling based view
of the world not being successfully coupled to an appropriate level of Introverted
Sensation. Without this internal balance, the ESFJs perceptions and ideas are determined
by feeling judgements which are not in always a valid basis for understanding.\nESFJs are usually stable, certain, reliable and caring in their approach
to life, but if unbalanced they are likely to treat any point of view other
than their own with a kind of amused indifference or a tendency to keep those
with differing attitudes and opinions at a distance. Whilst this is natural
survival behaviour for the strongly expressed ESFJ personality, if they do not
learn how to deal with the wide range of differing viewpoints they come into
contact with, ESFJs can find themselves waging a self created war against all
that opposes their own. This conflict often expresses itself in various unambiguous
and simplistic "Us verses Them" generalities, or a penchant for smugly and
narrowly defining other people by arbitrary or superstitious belief systems,
which often actually symbolise and define their own conflict. At its worst,
this conflict with the obstinate and unfeeling contingent realities of the
world creates a situation where the ESFJ retreats to a kind of psychological
castle where, not only none but those who have the "right" or "nice" approach
can enter, but also where the ESFJs feeling based and often tortured logic,
attitudes and judgments reign supreme and cannot be questioned; a place where:
"give and you shall receive" can ironically twist quickly into: "off with his
head!"\nThe main driver to the ESFJ personality is Extraverted Feeling, whose
function is to judge the relative human value of the ideas, behaviours,
situations and objects they perceive.
The resulting world view is tidy, and ordered according to its worth to the
ESFJ's own particular character: "Everything has its place and everything in
its place". If this picture of the world is threatened by external influences,
the ESFJ generally tries to shut such new information out of their lives. This
is totally natural, and works well to protect the individual psyche from
getting hurt. However, the ESFJ who exercises this type of self-protection
regularly will find they can only connect and relate with those who do not
actively disturb their increasingly narrow and rigid world view. They will
always find justification for their own inappropriate behaviours, and will
always find fault with the outside world for problems that they have in their
lives. It will be difficult for them to maintain the flexibility needed for a
healthy relationship with the messy world outside because the differing ways
others value things is a constant affront to their personal judgements.\nIt is not an uncommon tendency for the ESFJ to support their feeling
judgements by selectively using only their immediate perceptions of a situation
and how it appears to them. However, if this tendency is given free reign, the
resulting ESFJ personality is too self-centred to be happy or successful. The ESFJ's
auxiliary function of Introverted Sensing must be allowed to grow beyond this
limit, where it is used only to support Extraverted Feeling judgements. If the ESFJ
uses Introverted Sensing only to serve this purpose, then the ESFJ is not using
Introversion effectively at all. As a result, the ESFJ does not sufficiently
recognise and understand the vast number of contingent and differing ways in
which the world is perceived by others. They see nothing but their own
perspective, and deal with the world only so far as they need to in order to
support their perspective. These individuals usually come across as somewhat illogical
and full of fixed and often rather staid or conventional ideas about the world.
Other people are often surprised by the simplicity, ambiguity and often
unrelenting vehemence of their ideas.\nSolutions\nTo grow as an individual, the ESFJ needs to focus on opening their
perspective to include a more accurate picture of the world and its ways. In
order to be in a position in which the ESFJ is able to perceive and consider
data that is foreign to their value system, the ESFJ needs to recognise that
their world view is not threatened by the new information. The ESFJ must
consciously tell himself/herself that the judgements of others are not unrelated
to reality; that the ideas of others are also just and valid within a wider and
less rigorous vision of the world.\nThe ESFJ who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention
to the way things appear to them. Do they try to find the basic connections
between the elements of a situation? Or, do they appreciate only those elements
which accord them a feeling of worth? At the moment when some connection or
relationship between things is perceived, is the ESFJ only concerned with
whether that perception supports something they value? Or is she/he concerned
with becoming truly appraised of how things fit together in the world? To
achieve a better understanding of others and the world in which they live, the ESFJ
should try to put themselves into the minds of others, to locate and recognise
how others see things, before making judgements. They should consciously be
aware of their tendency to discard anything that doesn't agree with their
carefully adjudicated system of relative worth, and work towards lessening this
tendency. They should try to see the way others might see situations, without
making personal judgments about how others ought to feel. In general, they
should work on exercising their Sensation in a truly introverted sense. In
other words, they should use Sensation to recognise that all parts of a
situation are necessary for its functionality and that valuing one function or
objective connection over another narrows their ability to deal with the real
world as it truly is. The ESFJ who can successfully envision the world as a
realm of functioning and connected parts which are all necessary to its balance
can be quite a powerful force for positive change.\nLiving happily in our world as an ESFJ\nSome ESFJs have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are
often a result of an inability understand the connections and relationships
necessary to each situation, a too conventional and dogmatic set of values
which limits the way others can relate to them, or an unrealistic and illogical
view of the world. These issues mostly stem from using Introverted Sensation in
a diminished manner: the lack of a strong internally focused viewpoint allowing
an often ambiguous and yet strongly defended set of values to control the
personality. An ESFJ who attempts to envision a more accurate and impartial
view of the world for the sake of understanding the ways of others, rather than
quickly deciding how things alone affect them, will have a clearer, more
objective understanding of how society is dependant not only upon adherence to
values and care for others, but also how the world relies upon structure and
laws which function regardless of their human value. He or she will also be
more comfortable and less likely to demand that the world and the behaviour of
others conform to values of right and wrong, good and bad, worthy and worthless
etc. Such well-adjusted ESFJs will fit happily into our society.\nUnless you really understand
Psychological Type and the nuances of the various personality functions, it's a
difficult task to suddenly start to use Sensation in an unambiguous and totally
introverted direction. It's difficult to even understand what that means, much
less to incorporate that directive into your life. With that in mind, I am
providing some specific suggestions that may help you to begin exercising your Introverted
Sensation more fully:\nTake care to try and
     discover how others see things. Try to notice the connections they make
     between ideas and objects. Don't immediately compare your own vision of
     things to theirs; simply accept that for them the world fits together in a
     valid way.\nThink of those times and
     situations in your life when you felt misunderstood or disregarded by
     others. Now try to understand how one or two other people would see the
     situation. Don't try to assume they would judge as you do: "she would
     have to feel the same way if that happened to her", or "he would
     change his tune if he saw things from my point of view". Rather, try
     to understand how they would truly see the situation. Would they analyse
     it through a code of values, or see it as an opportunity to grasp a wider
     perspective in which a solution can be found? Would it affect them
     personally or would they view it impartially? Try to determine their point
     of view without passing judgment or comparing it to your own.\nWhen having a
     conversation with a friend or relative, dedicate at least half of your
     time to finding out how the other person sees the world around them.
     Concentrate on really sensing the relationships within what they describe.
     Tell them how you see the world and compare. Ask questions about why things
     seem so to them.\nThink of the people who
     are closest to you. As you think of each person, tell yourself "this
     person has their own life going on, and they are more concerned with their
     own life than they are with mine." Remember that this doesn't mean
     that they don't care about you. It's the natural order of things. Try to
     visualize what that person is seeing right now. What connections are they
     making or enacting, what thoughts are they having? Don't pass judgment, or
     compare their situation to your own.\nTry to identify the
     personality type of everyone that you come into contact with for any
     length of time.\nTen rules to live by to achieve ESFJ success\nFeed your strengths!\nLet your talent for caring and
        giving spill out into the world around you, show your gifts to the world. Allow
        yourself to take opportunities to nurture and develop situations in your home
        and work environments which bring value for yourself and others. Find work or a
        hobby which allows you to realise these strengths.\nFace your weaknesses!\nRealize and accept that some
        things are never going to be how you would like them to be. Understand that
        other peoples need to deal with the world regardless of how it seems. Facing
        and dealing with discord or differences in others doesn't mean that you have to
        change who you are; it means that you are giving yourself opportunities to
        grow. By facing your weaknesses, you honour your true self and that of others.\nDoscover the world of others.\nDon't let
        yourself fall into the trap of thinking you always know what is right for
        others. Open your heart to the possibility of understanding that their true
        needs are something that must be discovered through a recognition that their view
        of the world might be very different, yet just as valid as your own.\nDon't be too hasty.\nTry to let things settle before
        you make a judgement, allowing others to discover the best for themselves while
        you try to see all the variables and contingencies in a situation.\nLook carefully at the world.\nRemember,
        things are not always what they seem on the surface. You might need to look
        deeper to discover the truth, particularly when it seems you are sure of your
        first quick judgement. There are layers of meaning and truth beneath
        everything.\nLet others take some of the load.\nBy letting
        others make their own judgements, you are not letting things get out of
        control, but are validating their own need to be a part of your life. Remember,
        it is better to guide another to see your point of view than keeping them out
        of the picture.\nBe accountable to others.\nRemember that
        they need to understand you and your needs too. Express your doubts and
        difficulties as well as your reasons and let them become partners to your
        goals.\nDon't hem yourself in.\nStaying in your comfort zone is self defeating in the end. Try to make
        every day one where you get out and discover a little something different about
        the world and others. This will broaden your horizons and bring new ideas and
        opportunities into focus.\nAssume the best and seek for it.\nDon't wait for
        others to live up to your expectations. Every person has a goldmine of worth in
        them, just as every situation can be turned to some good. If you let yourself
        believe this, you will find yourself discovering ways to make it true for you.\nWhen in doubt, ask for help!\nDon't let your fears leave you on the
        horns of a dilemma or lead you into disaster. If you are uncertain of something
        or someone then get input from others who have greater experience in dealing
        with this difficulty.\nMore resources\nESFJ\nProfile\nESFJ\nCareers\nESFJ\nRelationships\nType\nTheory\nx
