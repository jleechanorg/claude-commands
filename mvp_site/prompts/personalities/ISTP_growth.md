tuned into their immediate environment, and driven to interact with it in a hands-on fashion.
It is by working with things in their environment that they experience and understand life.
By working physically with their environment, they have a natural and immediate understanding
of how things work, and how best to achieve their identified goals.  Although they constantly
use logic to determine how to best manipulate objects in their immediate situation, they are not 
naturally analytical in a more objective sense.  When they step back to methodically analyze
the relationship between objects in their world, they often lose touch with their understanding.
Their understanding is
intimately tied into their physical experience with reality.  It is immediate and wholistic.
They are naturally "in-sync" with the physical world, and value life largely in terms of their
ability to flow with and conquer the physical challenges presented to them.  Although
they think about and value past experiences, they live almost entirely in the here and now.
ISTPs are natural mechanics, athletes, musicians, technicians, and engineers.  They excel at 
tasks that require a great deal of tactile mastery, as well as quick, logic-based action.  
ISTPs are most comfortable using their known skills, rather than being thrown into situations
with which they have no personal experience.  The nuances of variation in each individual
situation will bring a sense of newness and freshness to the experience for the ISTP.  ISTPs
often resist and rebel situations that are entirely new, or that require a great deal of
structured planning and thinking.  This way of thinking is foreign to the ISTP, and therefore
uncomfortable.  When someone tries to push or control the ISTP into these situations, he or
she is likely to "walk away" from that person without looking back.  Their resistance to
structure may cause them to quit school early, quit jobs that they find stifling, or quit
relationships that have too many expectations.  ISTPs are often likeable and have more friends
and social interaction than is normal for an Introvert.  The ISTP genuinely enjoys the
company of their friends, and needs their input in his or her physical world to maintain their
understanding of their own place in the world.  An ISTP's feeling of success is dependent primarily
upon their mastery of their physical world, but is also dependent upon the existence of strong,
reliable, interpersonal relationships.  Without these relationships, the ISTP is likely to
avoid relationships, isolate him or herself, and feel very vulnerable to rejection and hurt.\nAllowing your ISTP strengths to flourish\nAs an ISTP, you have gifts that are specific to your personality type
    that aren't natural strengths for other types. By recognizing your special
    gifts and encouraging their growth and development, you will more readily see
    your place in the world, and be more content with your role.\nNearly all ISTPs will recognize the following characteristics in themselves.  They should embrace and nourish these strengths:\nThey have a natural ability to focus and "become one" with their immediate environment.  
          This ability allows them to be great athletes, dancers, and musicians.  They have an innately 
          graceful connection with the physical world.\nThey are highly in tune with their physical surroundings, and therefore have well-developed
          aesthetic appreciation.  They appreciate beauty.  If they are so inclined, they may develop
          their ability to control the physical world into some form of art expression, and become artists.\nThey are exceptional troubleshooters in emergency situations.  They can quickly take in
          the current situation and apply logic immediately to take steps that control the problem.  
          Since the ISTP's use of logic is based on their personal experience, their ability to 
          troubleshoot will get better and better as they gain more experience.  For this reason, ISTPs
          who are mechanics, technicians, and computer analysts (for example) often achieve "guru"
          status after they have been working in the field for a long time.\nThey're very sensual and earthy people.  They usually have a good deal of sex appeal and
          attractive sensuality.\nISTPs who have developed their Extraverted Sensing to the extent that they regularly take
      in information in an objective fashion, rather than strictly to support their own way of life,
      will enjoy these special gifts:\nThey have attractive and compelling personalities, and are well-liked and accepted
            by most people.\nThey're usually quite intelligent, and can work through difficult problems.\nThey can handle just about any task that they are presented with.\nThey understand the benefits of close relationships, and understand how to
            support and enhance these relationships.\nThey're able to identify their own feelings and the feelings of others.\nPotential problem areas\nWith any gift of strength, there is an associated weakness. Without
  "bad", there would be no "good". Without
  "difficult", there would be no "easy". We value our
  strengths, but we often curse and ignore our weaknesses. To grow as a person
  and get what we want out of life, we must not only capitalize upon our
  strengths, but also face our weaknesses and deal with them. That means taking a
  hard look at our personality type's potential problem areas.\nMost of the weaker characteristics that are found in ISTPs are due to
their dominant function of Introverted Thinking overtaking the personality to the
point that all of the other functions exist merely to serve the purposes of Introverted
Thinking.
In such cases, an ISTP may show some or all of the following weaknesses in varying degrees:\nThe ISTP gets "stuck in a rut" and only does those things that are known and comfortable
           to the ISTP.\nThe ISTP resists and rejects anything that doesn't support their own experiential
           understanding of the world.  If there is a conflict between their own way of life and something
           that they encounter, they don't perceive that "something" in an objective sense.  Rather,
           they reject it to avoid conflict and to preserve the sanctity of their inner world.\nThey choose to surround themselves with people who support their own way of life, and reject
           people who think or live differently.\nThey may become overly paranoid about social organizations and institutions trying to
           control them.\nThey may unknowingly or uncaringly hurt people's feelings.\nThey may be completely unaware of how to express their inner world to others in a 
           meaningful way.\nThey may be completely unaware of the type of communication that is often desireable
           and (to some degree) expected in an intimate relationship.  If they are aware of the kinds
           of things that are appropriate to say and do to foster emotional bonding, they may be unable
           to appreciate the value of such actions.  They may feel too vulnerable to express themselves
           in this fashion, and so reject the entire idea.\nIf pushed beyond their comfort level to form commitments or emotional bonds, they may 
           reject a relationship entirely.\nUnder stress, they may show intense emotions that seem disproportionate to the situation.\nThey may be unclear how they feel about certain issues and situations, and react by ignoring
           them, however important or relevant the issues are to their own life.\nExplanation of problems\nNearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be
attributed in various degrees to the common ISTP problem of only taking
in information that relates to or supports their own life experience. 
The ISTP is driven to work with and understand his or her world
by applying their special brand of logic (an immediate, spatial, "fuzzy" logic)
to their physical experience.  They don't necessarily have a goal in mind
to achieve from this process - it is the process itself that is rewarding
to the ISTP.  In their zeal for the satisfaction that comes from mastering
their physical environment in such a way, ISTPs often selectively choose 
to put themselves in situations in which they have the opportunity to
exercise these skills.  That's certainly not a problem.  Most personality
types choose to do the things that they're best at most often.  Such is
the nature of capitalizing upon our strengths.  The problem rears its ugly
head when the goal of the ISTP becomes to achieve their personal satisfaction
at all costs.\nIt is healthy to choose your paths and goals in life so that they coincide with
what you find rewarding, and what you're really good at.  However, it sometimes
happens that we take this approach a bit too far and sacrifice an accurate and
objective understanding of the world for a more narrow vision that is easier
and comfortable for us to deal with.  The ISTP affects this problem when they
stop taking in information in a truly objective sense, and instead only take
in information that supports their way of life.\nThe dominant function of the ISTP is Introverted Thinking.  This function is 
supported closely and importantly by the auxiliary function of Extraverted
Sensing.  Extraverted Sensing perceives the world and sends information into
the psyche, where it is processed by Introverted Thinking.  An ISTP who uses
their Extraverted Sensing function in a diminished way is one who chooses to
restrict their environment to people and places that support their favored
activities.  In such a way, the ISTP prevents his or her psyche from having
to consider data from differing viewpoints and lifestyles, and thus promotes
a lifestyle that allows them to frequently exercise and enhance their known 
tactile skills.  It serves their immediate needs, which are the primary focus
of the ISTP.  However, it also promotes a lifestyle that is essentially
self-centered and narrow in focus.  It solves short-term problems, and creates
long-term ones.\nThe ISTP's inferior (fourth) function is Extraverted Feeling.  This means that
the ISTP is not naturally in tune with how other people are feeling, or with
social expectations.  In fact, the ISTP is likely to reject the importance of
social rituals, rules, and expectations.  This is a natural weak point for the
ISTP, which no doubt causes strife to the ISTP and their love partner.  This
weakness can be overcome by developing their Extraverted Sensing to the point
that they can perceive Feeling type expectations in the external world.  They
don't have to use Extraverted Feeling to understand how to act in situations.
They can perceive the expected behavior from their Extraverted Sensing function.
However, if they are restricting their incoming data to only those things that
support their existing way of life, then they are not learning from Extraverted
Sensing at all.  They are not growing their understanding of social and intimate
behaviors - rather, they are reducing the importance of this type of understanding
to their own life.  In these situations, ISTPs shy away from very close personal
relationships, and feel more vulnerable and less sure of themselves in situations
that involve expressing their emotions.\nSolutions\nTo grow as an individual, the ISTP needs to focus on taking in as much information
as possible through Extraverted Sensing.  He or she needs to allow themself to get
into situations that they aren't necessarily comfortable with, or that are different
from the situations that they would normally choose in life.  The ISTP learns from
experience, so the best way for the ISTP to grow as a person is to open him or herself to
new experiences.  Be aware of the tendency to want to run out and do something "new" that
is actually just a different opportunity to exercise a known skill.  Your task, as a
person interested in personal growth, is to understand the world in a truly objective
fashion, rather than understanding how the world fits in with your way of life.\nLiving happily in our world as an ISTP\nISTPs usually have a loyal group of friends that they fit in with and feel comfortable
with.  The problems that ISTPs have with regards to fitting into our world are not
usually related to platonic friendships.  Usually, the ISTP has trouble finding and
maintaining a love relationship.  The ISTP usually has very simple needs and
expectations from their mates, and they're surprised and confused to find that their
mates have more complex demands.  They feel inadequate to meeting their mate's
needs, and begin to get very uncomfortable with the situation as they perceive
that they are expected to do something that it unknown to them.  They back away
from the relationship.  Outside of a relationship, they feel more unloved and
unappreciated, but are afraid to commit to a relationship because they fear
rejection and hurt.\nSpecific suggestions:\nDon't expect yourself to be a master at the "touchy-feely" game.  Be yourself, but
           remember that there is a basic assumption of human decency that must be adhered
           to in relationships.  If you're not sure what that means, take 
           special care to observe how people in "good" committed relationships behave 
           towards each other, so that you can determine where the lines are drawn.\nPair yourself with an Extraverted Thinker (ESTJ or ENTJ) who is less likely
           to assume that the lack of feedback is the same thing as negative feedback.\nExpanding your world and experiences will expand your understanding of human
           expectations.  Try to figure out the personality type of people that you know
           and encounter in your life.\nDon't fear the unknown.  You can handle it.\nTen rules to live by to achieve ISTP success\nFeed your strengths!\nRealize your gift at mastering your physical
        environment, and give yourself plenty of opportunities to exercise your abilities.  Ride,
        play, paint, work it. Much of your sense of well-being will come from these experiences.\nFace your weaknesses!\nFace your fear of the unknown, and get yourself
        into new situations.  Experience new activities and people with new perspectives.  Don't
        isolate yourself into a narrow and lonely existence.\nTalk about your thoughts.\nDiscussing your ideas and perceptions with
        others will help you to develop your Extraverted Sensing, and thus your understanding of 
        the world.  How well you use your auxiliary function is very important to your overall 
        health and happiness.\nDon't be afraid to love.\nThat's just your old inferior function trying
        to convince you that you're unloved and unloveable.  It's not true.  Just because you're
        not sure what to do with yourself doesn't mean that you can't learn!  Go on...  jump in.  
        The water's warm.\nRespect your need for action.\nUnderstand that you need to be actively
        working with your environment to be "in the groove" with life.  Don't chastise yourself
        for not being the sort to sit around and read a book or watch a movie.  Choose a partner
        and companions who value active lifestyles.\nRecognize social principles.\nRealize that our society functions around
        some basic social principles, and that our society would fail unless those principles are
        recognized and upheld.  In a democracy, people vote.  At a red stoplight, people stop.
        If people stopped voting because it wasn't important to their own way of life, who would be
        in power?  If people stopped stopping at red stop lights because it didn't fit into their
        way of life, how could we drive safely?  Your priorities and beliefs are important, but you must 
        recognize that the external world's agenda is also important.\nIt's okay to get out of your comfort zone.\nUnderstand that the only way to 
        grow is to get outside of your comfort zone.  If you're uncomfortable with an idea or
        situation because you're not sure how to act, that's good!  That's an opportunity for
        growth.\nIdentify and express your feelings.\nYou may have a hard time figuring
        out exactly how you feel about someone that you're involved with.  It's important that
        you do figure this out.  Don't lead someone on with your ambivalence.  If you determine
        that you value the person, tell them so every time you think of it.  This is the best way
        to make them feel secure in your affections, and so to promote a long-lasting relationship.\nBe aware of others.\nTry to really identify where people are coming
        from.  Their ideas, thoughts and priorities are differents from yours.  They have something
        to offer you.  Try to identify their personality types.\nAssume the best.\nDon't distress yourself with fear and dark imaginings.
        Expect the best, and the best will come.\nMore resources\nISTP\nProfile\nISTP\nCareers\nISTP\nRelationships\nType\nTheory\nx
