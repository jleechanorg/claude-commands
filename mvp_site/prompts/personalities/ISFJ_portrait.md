takes things in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion.
Your secondary mode is external, where you deal
with things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit into
your personal value system.\nISFJs live in a world that is concrete and kind.  They are truly warm
and kind-hearted, and want to believe the best of people.  They value
harmony and cooperation, and are likely to be very sensitive to other
people's feelings.  People value the ISFJ for their consideration and
awareness, and their ability to bring out the best in others by their
firm desire to believe the best.\nISFJs have a rich inner world that is not usually obvious to observers.
They constantly take in information about people and situations that is
personally important to them, and store it away.  This tremendous store of
information is usually startlingly accurate, because the ISFJ has an
exceptional memory about things that are important to their value systems.
It would not be uncommon for the ISFJ to remember a particular 
facial expression or conversation in precise detail years after the event
occured, if the situation made an impression on the ISFJ.\nISFJs have very clear ideas about the way things should be, and strive
to attain those ideals.  They value security and kindness, and respect traditions and
laws.  They tend to believe that existing systems are there because they
work.  Therefore, they're not likely to buy into doing things in a new way,
unless they're shown in a concrete way why its better than the established
method.\nISFJs learn best by doing, rather than by reading about something in a book,
or applying theory.  For this reason, they are not likely to be found in
fields that require a lot of conceptual analysis or theory.  They value
practical application.  Traditional methods of higher education that require
a lot of theorizing and abstraction are likely to be a chore for the ISFJ.
The ISFJ learns a task best by being shown its practical application.
Once the task is learned, and its practical importance is understood,
the ISFJ will faithfully and tirelessly carry through the task
to completion.  The ISFJ is extremely dependable.\nThe ISFJ has an extremely well-developed sense of space, function, and
aesthetic appeal.  For that reason, they're likely to have beautifully
furnished, functional homes.  They make extremely good interior decorators.
This special ability, combined with their sensitivity to other's feelings
and desires, makes them very likely to be great gift-givers - finding
the right gift that will be truly appreciated by the recipient.\nMore so than other types, ISFJs are extremely aware of their own 
internal feelings, as well as other people's feelings.  They do not
usually express their own feelings, keeping things inside.  
If they are negative feelings, they may build up inside the ISFJ until
they turn into firm judgments against individuals that are difficult
to unseed, once set.  Many ISFJs learn to express themselves, and find
outlets for their powerful emotions.\nJust as the ISFJ is not likely to express their feelings, they are also
not likely to let on that they know how others are feeling.  However, they
will speak up when they feel another individual really needs help, and in
such cases they can truly help others become aware of their feelings.\nThe ISFJ feels a strong sense of responsibility and duty.  They take
their responsibilities very seriously, and can be counted on to follow
through.  For this reason, people naturally tend to rely on them.
The ISFJ has a difficult time saying "no" when asked to do something, and
may become over-burdened.  In such cases, the ISFJ does not usually express
their difficulties to others, because they intensely dislike conflict, and
because they tend to place other people's needs over their own.
The ISFJ needs to learn to identify, value, and express their own needs, if they
wish to avoid becoming over-worked and taken for granted.\nISFJs need positive feedback from others.  In the absence of positive feedback,
or in the face of criticism, the ISFJ gets discouraged, and may even
become depressed.  When down on themselves or under great stress, the ISFJ
begins to imagine all of the things that might go critically wrong in their
life.  They have strong feelings of inadequacy, and become convinced that 
"everything is all wrong", or "I can't do anything right." In such situations, the
ISFJ would do well to remember that their feelings of doom with pass with their stress.\nThe ISFJ is warm, generous, and dependable.  They have many special gifts
to offer, in their sensitivity to others, and their strong ability to 
keep things running smoothly.  They need to remember to not be overly
critical of themselves, and to give themselves some of the warmth and
love that they freely dispense to others.\n*Read about the ISFJ's Jungian type,\nIntroverted Sensing\n, or
