Extraverted Sensing, and an auxiliary function of Introverted Thinking, people with
the ESTP personality type have a heightened need for sensory experience and for
tactile engagement with their physical environment.
The ESTP is most comfortable when they can
treat life as a big game in which they must be quick to use their skills in
order to win.  In such a game-playing
scenario, the ESTP is most likely to be the winner, as no other personality
type is as quick on their feet as the ESTP.\nESTPs
have an amazingly ability to size up
people in an instant and come up with an accurate ballpark understanding of
where they are coming from.  The ESTP
cannot help using this skill, it is natural for them, but it brings them great
satisfaction to be able to use this skill to enact some personal gain, or to "win
the game."  The ESTP is also strongly
driven to tangibly interact with their immediate physical environment.
This need manifests itself in many ways, most
commonly as an attraction to sports or physical challenges, and as a desire to
always be doing something.
ESTPs are the great Doers.
If you want to make something happen quickly, ask an ESTP.
These inherent skills make the ESTP likely to
find success professionally as salespeople or professional athletes.
However, any career that capitalizes on their
people skills or their ability to maneuver within their physical world AND
gives them immediate feedback is likely to be a good fit for the ESTP.\nESTPs
need to be engaged with their immediate, external world makes success on a
personal level more challenging.  They
feel happiest when they are outside of themselves, but personal success
requires going within to get to know the self.
However, once these needs are recognized, they are not mutually
exclusive.  The ESTP who feeds their
constant drive for new sensory experiences 
as well as their need for real
reflection upon those experiences and impressions will find a deeper level of
personal satisfaction than the ESTP who allows his immediate needs for sensory
experiences to yank him about.\nHowever, even those ESTPs
who have developed their ability to reflect on
matters will always be connected at some base level to the strong desire for
new experiences, and will get their "bread and butter" feelings of success from
conquering challenges in their physical environment.
ESTPs need to know
they've got the goods, won the moment, done the job. Once given a task that
intrigues them, or having discovered something new to be tried, very little
will stop them from doing all they can to meet the challenge, and thereby
achieve what they consider to be a personal success.
Success to an ESTP is usually not measured in
ongoing terms, but in transient moments of achievement, moments which bring the
ESTP the needed feeling of having won the day.\nAllowing your ESTP strengths to flourish\nAs an ESTP, you have gifts that are specific to your personality type
    that aren't natural strengths for other types. By recognizing your special
    gifts and encouraging their growth and development, you will more readily see
    your place in the world, and be more content with your role.\nNearly all ESTPs will recognize the following characteristics in themselves.  They should embrace and nourish these strengths:\nA great talent for reading people and knowing "where they're at" by just watching
          their behavior and mannerisms.\nThe ability to draw upon an extremely detailed and ready knowledge of the physical
          world around them at a moment's notice.\nA competitive flair which drives them to win out in difficult situations. 
          ESTPs love to have the odds stacked against them, which
          makes them great troubleshooters or the type of salespeople who can cold
          canvass a winning deal from the hardest client.\nA mental toughness which makes them extremely hard to beat. In any contest, the
          ESTP will almost always be the last man standing.\nA strong, "get after it" mentality that causes them to get things done.\nESTPs who have developed their Introverted Thinking to the extent that they consider what their perceptions mean to them and discriminate carefully between the options available rather than simply flowing with the process of the moment, will enjoy these special gifts:\nThe ability to recognize when others are uncomfortable or in trouble and deal with their problems.\nThe ability to realize that there is value in meeting other people's needs in a real way.\nAn understanding that other people may have a different perspective on life, and
             that other perspectives may be useful and valid.\nAn ability to make the most of their winning capabilities over a long term.\nA special talent for showing others how to make the most of situations. Such 
             ESTPs can be extraordinary teachers of positive life skills.\nA knack for showing not only how certain things can be done, but how they can be
             done in a far more valuable or efficient way. Such ESTPs
             are an asset to any company involved in manufacturing.\nA skill for understanding the behavior of people and predicting patterns.\nESTPs can make very good detectives or analysts.\nPotential problem areas\nWith any gift of strength, there is an associated weakness. Without
  "bad", there would be no "good". Without
  "difficult", there would be no "easy". We value our
  strengths, but we often curse and ignore our weaknesses. To grow as a person
  and get what we want out of life, we must not only capitalize upon our
  strengths, but also face our weaknesses and deal with them. That means taking a
  hard look at our personality type's potential problem areas.\nIt is important to realize that
type weaknesses are just the blind spots behind our stronger character traits, and
that the more undesirable characteristics specific to a type are usually
limited to those people whose type is heavily expressed, and then only if
circumstances have combined to narrow or circumvent that person's natural
development. So in reading what follows, it is worth remembering that, in
describing these typical tendencies and the negative patterns of behavior which
can flow from them, we are building an understanding for positive development.
Every person is differently made, and we must always remember that these so
called "weaknesses" are the unavoidable, understandable and natural
characteristics of our type.\nMost of the weaker
characteristics found in ESTPs result from
Extraverted Sensing dominating their personality and co-opting the usefulness
of their other functions, whilst some other difficulties stem directly from the\nESTP's\ninability to use their less adapted functions
of Extraverted Feeling and Introverted Intuition. Either singly or in
combination, these ESTP traits cause most or all of the following weaknesses in
varying degrees:\nCan become morose or even antagonistic in situations offering little promise of
        advantage or the possibility to "do something."\nMay be manipulative, taking advantage of other people's weaknesses for their own gain.\nMay be unwilling or unable to plan anything in advance themselves, or to follow
        other's careful plans.\nCan be overconfident of their own cunning or ability, ignoring problems which
        eventually catch up with them on their blind side.\nMay find it difficult or be actually unwilling to follow through where an ongoing
        commitment is expected.\nIn relationship situations may be overbearing, demanding and/or uncaring of the
        feelings of their partner.\nWhen alone or in reduced circumstances may be subject to dark or morbid feelings
        about themselves.\nMay be unable to maintain employment for any length of time, losing credibility
        with potential employers or clients by job hopping.\nMay become so engrossed in challenging activities that they lose all sense of
        proportion, neglecting themselves and their relationships.\nWithout challenges of their own, may become focused on the behavior of others,
        particularly that of family or employees, insisting that they live up to what
        the ESTP sees as the proper code or level of accomplishment.\nExplanation of problems\nBecause the ESTP is driven to
experience the world through concrete sensation, their need for sensual
experience combines with the possibilities of the moment to provide everything
they feel is necessary to life. Using Introverted Thinking only to justify or
enhance their sensual needs, the ESTP can easily flow with the world in a
reckless manner, their own behavior mapped and justified by a ruling grid
locked only to the objective action of the moment. Many of the difficulties
described above flow from this common ESTP trait of attending only to the world
and the people around them for the sake of satisfying their constant need for
fresh experiences and new conquests. For the ESTP who lacks the support of a
well adapted rational, judging function, the objective world remains an
endlessly fascinating playground, where the constantly changing rules of the
game often provide the only real codes of conduct they live by.\nWithout a well developed
Introverted Thinking function enabling the ESTP to reflect upon the
consequences of their actions and desires, the feelings and needs of others can
seem of little concern to them. Often, those who cannot match the ESTP round
for round are considered persons of little consequence, or valued only as
useful pawns in an endless game of one-upmanship where the gratification of the\nESTPs\nneeds is the only object. In addition to this,
because Feeling is the\nESTP's\ntertiary function, its
judgments tend to be colored by the unconscious background, which means that it
is often used negatively. In responding to the\nESTP's\nsense driven thinking assessments, such a feeling function plays down empathy
and enhances the maintenance of negative feelings about others, particularly
when they do not "go along" with the\nESTP's\nprimary
function driven ways and needs.\nUnder such conditions the
strongly expressing ESTP, whose auxiliary Introverted Thinking function serves
only to make biased, supportive, "correct" judgments about their own behavior,
will often "stand outside the circle", their biased judgments reducing others
to a mere audience, expected to support the\nESTPs\nnotions without question. In relationships this can be a danger, for it means
the ESTP will rarely accede to the feeling based demands of others, nor give
credit to those ideas which arise from an intuitive outlook on life. Their
behavior in this regard often borders on outright contempt or a sullen refusal
to accept anything outside their own purview.\nSuch strongly expressing ESTPs
can sometimes find themselves without any truly close
relationships, for their behavior often provides a strong signal to others, who
sense that "here be dragons", and consequently offer as little as possible of
their personal feelings or worldly knowledge as grist to the 
ESTPs one-upmanship mill. Under these circumstances, whilst
the ESTP may have lots of acquaintances and partners in fun, there will be very
few who will befriend them at any truly supportive, emotional level.\nApart from the reasons given
above, some narrowly expressing\nESTPs\ncan sometimes
find themselves isolated because of the unusual things they believe about
people and the world - particularly in regard to the reasons they believe
certain things happen. The ESTP is extremely familiar with the workings of the
immediate, rational world of the senses, but because their Intuition is a
virtually unconscious function, their ideas about things outside their ken can
quite often be extraordinarily quaint, superstitious or just downright bizarre,
and their thinking can weave some amazing logic to support these beliefs. This
rarely affects their day to day life, for these ideas and superstitions quite
often support their keenness and abilities, but in a situation where truly
intuitive or theoretical notions are considered relevant and important, the
ESTP can find themself very much the odd man out.\nOf all the personality types,
the strongly expressing ESTP can be the hardest to convince that their world
view is not the only valid one; that it does not necessarily spring from the
best and only way to be; that everyone else in the world who is "normal" does
not approach life in the same way as the ESTP.\nSolutions\nTo grow as an individual, the
ESTP needs to focus on freeing their thinking from the control of Extraverted
Sensing and allow\nthemself\nthe space to make careful,
rational judgments. Not only about the immediate, external situation, but also
about the ways in which it can be managed to create a more valuable, long term
result. The\nESTP's\ncapacity to do this is innate; it
hides just beneath the surface and takes only a few deliberate moments to allow
it to work. All the ESTP needs to do is to recognize the difference between
thinking with the moment, with the subject of their immediate sense impressions,
and the thinking they do when nothing else grasps their attention. The ESTP
needs to recognize that the second kind of thinking, this "alone with self"
space, is full of potential for careful judgment of their actions and
consideration of the best course for the future. Introverted Thinking is in
truth the ESTP secret weapon. It is Introverted Thinking working in the
background of their life which makes the ESTP such a potent personality.
Bringing it into the foreground, allowing its power to be no longer a secret to
them is the key to ESTP development.\nI want to offer the ESTP some
specific suggestions and advice here, for bringing the value of introspection
into focus it isn't just a matter of flipping a switch in the head. One of the
reasons for this is that, when uncoupled from the fascinations of the outer
world and reality, the\nESTP's\nIntroverted Thinking
tends to get caught up in the negative judgments and images which flow from
their feeling and intuitive functions; all too easily falling into a cloudy,
uncertain world of anxieties and sinister implications. The ESTP's
inner space needs to be cleared of this often childish and ill-informed miasma
of negativity. So it is necessary to reassure yourself, to calmly and
decisively insist upon quiet in your inner mind, and have faith that all
concerns will be taken care of by the "adult of the household" (the mature
version of Introverted Thinking.)\nTurning off the world and
getting into your own space can be difficult at the beginning, but it provides
the greatest rewards. For the ESTP doesn't need to learn how to think, they
already do it extremely well - they just need to turn their thinking upon
themselves. They need to measure and evaluate their usefulness, their actions,
their relationships in ways that look for quality, and in ways to offer value
to all things and people in their lives.\nChallenge yourself. Challenges
are simple stuff for the ESTP, and all it really takes is a few moments of
reflection each day. Ask yourself regularly: "What am I doing? Why am I doing
it? Who benefits from it?" Ask these questions in every type of situation, and
discover how the answers begin showing a path toward not only greater
understanding of self and others, but also show ways to include others in a
relationship with your whole self. Soon you will discover your feelings and
intuitions coming on board with a more positive and inclusive force. Growing
yourself soon becomes easy, because it just takes the simple routine of letting
your innate power of considered thought work upon your own life, rather than
only using it to support what's going on outside. Think about it.\nLiving Happily in our World as an ESTP\nESTPs usually have a strong group of
supporters, both at work and socially. They are often popular, their appeal is
magnetic and they attract those who would like to do the things they can do.
The problems the ESTP has fitting into the world tend to be related to the flip
side of this attractive and challenging exterior, for the deeper and more
intimate side of people tends to avoid them, just as the ESTP tends to avoid
the deeper connections.\nESTPs\nhave no trouble
attracting lovers and admirers, they simply have trouble keeping them, for once
relationships begin to demand constancy and deep, feeling based connections,
the ESTP is often left wondering what the fuss was about. Their inadequacy in
this regard can often make others feel they are lacking any real feelings or
desire for commitment, whilst the truth is that they simply do not know the
path to such things without a long and difficult learning period. They are more
frightened of feelings rather than unable to feel, they are more timid of
commitment rather than unable to commit. In relationships the ESTP needs
reassurance, but all too often their needs are unspoken and interpreted as
inabilities.\nSpecific Suggestions:\nAsk yourself what you want from a long term relationship. Now turn this around and
        see how your requirements compare with others. Are you being realistic? Have
        you forgotten to include the needs of others in your ideal relationship? Are
        you afraid of the things you need to offer, or are you just afraid that in
        offering them you will lose something?\nAlwas remember, that a relationship which adds to your personal skills and life is a valuable
        one, while a relationship which limits your ability to be yourself is not going
        to work. Now try to see how your own demands and needs might add to another,
        and what they might take away from them.\nDon't be afraid of letting your feelings show, even if they frighten you for their
        weakness or showing your own vulnerability. More often than not, such honesty
        is the beginning of the kind of relationship that can lead you to grow.\nYour best partner is going to be the one who fills your private space, your thinking
        space, as well as your senses. Try to talk to others about what you think.
        Discover yourself in your thoughts and let relationships grow through your
        letting the other person into your inner world. Discuss your fears and limits
        and discover the strength available to you from the support of another who may
        have what you need.\nTen rules to live by to achieve ESTP success\nFeed your strengths!\nGive yourself every opportunity to show
        your innate skills. If you are not in a relationship or a job which allows this
        to happen, it might be time to discover ways to change this. Remember, your
        strengths derive from being able to deal with the world, with situations where
        getting things done, where opportunities to surmount difficulty exist.\nFace your weaknesses!\nTry to be straight up with yourself. You have limitations others find
        as strengths. So what? You don't have to hide behind a curtain of fear just
        because you have difficulty with feelings or sorting out your inner
        perceptions. Allow yourself to be who you are and at the same time let others
        help you be more honest with your limitations.\nTalk about your thoughts.\nDiscussing your ideas and perceptions
        with others will help you to develop your separate, inner reality, make you a
        "real" person to them even without all that external activity. How well you use
        your auxiliary function is very important to your overall health and happiness.\nDont' be afraid to show emotion.\nYour inferior functions want you to be
        still a child inside, and that makes you run, that makes you want to prove
        yourself even more. You don't have to prove anything to anyone in this regard.
        Everyone feel emotion and everyone is a little child inside. Find those people
        whose eyes tell you that you are not alone, and let them hear your child's
        voice.\nRespect your need for action.\nUnderstand that you need to be actively
        working with your environment to be "in the groove" with life. Don't
        chastise yourself for not being the sort to sit around and read a book or watch
        a movie. Choose a partner and companions who value active lifestyles, but
        remember to allow yourself time out to consider how their input into your life
        will change it. Don't just follow your nose - life is not an endless party or
        expedition.\nRecognize the difference in others.\nRealize that everyone is different, not
        just a little different, but very different. Everyone has their place and
        value. You need to notice those values and places, places where you cannot
        easily fit. You can learn from these people, for they have gifts you can use,
        gifts they offer simply by being who they are. Try figuring out their
        psychological type for yourself and notice how certain types can lift you out
        of negative feelings just by being who they are.\nIt's okay to get out of your comfort zone.\nUnderstand that the only way to grow is
        to get outside of your comfort zone. If you're uncomfortable with an idea or
        situation because you're not sure how to act, that's good! That's an
        opportunity for growth.\nIdentify and express your feelings.\nYou may have a hard time figuring out
        exactly how you feel about someone that you're involved with. It's important
        that you do figure this out. Don't lead someone on with your ambivalence. If
        you determine that you value the person, tell them so every time you think of
        it. This is the best way to make them feel secure in your affections, and so to
        promote a long-lasting relationship.\nBe aware that you can fail, and that's okay.\nNot every mountain can be climbed, not every
        customer will be satisfied, no matter how hard you try or no matter what tricks
        you bring to bear. Getting beaten is an opportunity to reflect upon what is
        important, what really matters in life. Next time you will take up a challenge
        more worthy of your skills, and more valuable to others. You can be a champion,
        and it will be at your own game. Try to let it be a game of life, where
        everyone wins if you do.\nAssume the best.\nDon't distress yourself with fear and
        dark imaginings. Expect the best, and the best will come.\nMore resources\nESTP\nProfile\nESTP\nCareers\nESTP\nRelationships\nType\nTheory\nx
