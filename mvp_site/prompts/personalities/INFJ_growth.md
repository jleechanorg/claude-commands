They have deep insights into many aspects of life, and usually have very
high standards for their own understanding and accomplishments, as well
as those of others.  They are service-oriented and empathetic to other
individuals.  The INFJ strives for the ideal in every aspect of their life.
An INFJ's feeling of success is centered around their own level of
understanding and accomplishment, their usefulness or service to others,
and the condition of their personal relationships.  The INFJ feels
successful when they have used their very deep understanding of something
to do a real service for someone.  We often see INFJ personality types as
counsellors and teachers, or in the medical and health fields.\nAllowing your INFJ strengths to flourish\nAs an INFJ, you have gifts that are specific to your personality type
    that aren't natural strengths for other types. By recognizing your special
    gifts and encouraging their growth and development, you will more readily see
    your place in the world, and be more content with your role.\nNearly all INFJs will recognize the following characteristics in themselves.  They should embrace and nourish these strengths:\nThey're extremely insightful, and see things that are not obvious to 
          others.  This ability to see patterns and meanings in the world can help
          the INFJ in many different ways.  INFJs usually have a great deal of 
          insight into different people and situations.\nWhen given a goal or context, an INFJ is able to generate all kinds
          of possibilities.  They're able to see the problem from many different angles.\nThey understand how others are feeling, and are genuinely concerned
          with others.  This natural empathy and caring helps to be really effective
          at helping others through problems.  In this manner, they make great
          friends, counselors, teachers, and mates.\nAn INFJ has a "stick to it" attitude.  They're not afraid of hard
          work, and will put forth a great deal of effort towards something that they
          believe in.  This persistence will help the INFJ to achieve an identified goal.\nPerfectionistic and idealistic, they always strive for the best.\nUsually intelligent and able to concentrate and focus, the INFJ can
          usually grasp difficult ideas and concepts.\nINFJs who have a well-developed their Extraverted Feeling function to complement their dominant Introverted iNtuition will enjoy these special gifts:\nThey can turn their insightful understanding about a situation into
            a successful plan of action.\nThe INFJ with well-developed judgment will be able to grasp and 
            process concepts that are beyond what their natural intelligence appears
            to be able to handle.\nThey may achieve a level of understanding that makes them appear wise.\nThe INFJ's perfectionism and idealism, when combined with their
            empathy and genuine concern for others, can cause them to be true servants
            for people in some fashion.  They may be great doctors or ministers or 
            counselors.\nIf they have
            achieved a good amount of life wisdom, they can become powerful forces,
            such as Jesus (INFJ) and Mahatma Ghandi (INFJ).\nPotential problem areas\nWith any gift of strength, there is an associated weakness. Without
  "bad", there would be no "good". Without
  "difficult", there would be no "easy". We value our
  strengths, but we often curse and ignore our weaknesses. To grow as a person
  and get what we want out of life, we must not only capitalize upon our
  strengths, but also face our weaknesses and deal with them. That means taking a
  hard look at our personality type's potential problem areas.\nINFJs are rare and intelligent people with many special gifts.  This should
be kept in mind as you read some of the more negative material about INFJ
weaknesses.  Remember that these weaknesses are natural.  We offer this
information to enact positive change, rather than as blatant criticism.
We want you to grow into your full potential, and be the happiest and
most successful person that you can become.\nMost of the weaker characteristics that are found in INFJs are due to
their dominant function (Introverted iNtuition) overtaking their personality
to the point that the other forces in their personality exist merely to 
serve the purposes of Introverted iNtuition.
In such cases, an INFJ may show some or all of the following weaknesses in varying degrees:\nMay be unaware (and sometimes uncaring) of how they come across to others\nMay quickly dismiss input from others without really considering it\nMay apply their judgment more often towards others, rather than towards themselves\nWith their ability to see an issue from many sides, they may always find 
         others at fault for any problems in their lives\nMay have unrealistic and/or unreasonable expectations of others\nMay be intolerant of weaknesses in others\nMay believe that they're always right\nMay be obsessive and passionate about details that may be unimportant to the big picture\nMay be cuttingly derisive and sarcastic towards others\nMay have an intense and quick temper\nMay be tense, wound up, have high blood pressure and find it difficult to relax\nMay hold grudges, and have difficulty forgiving people\nMay be wishy-washy and unsure how to act in situations that require
         quick decision making\nMay have difficulty communicating their thoughts and feelings to others\nMay see so many tangents everywhere that they can't stay focused on the
         bottom line or the big picture\nExplanation of problems\nMost of the problems described above are a result of Introverted iNtuition
overtaking the INFJ's personality to the point that all of the other
functions become slaves to Introverted iNtuition.  A healthy personality
needs to have a good balance between its dominant and auxiliary functions.
For an INFJ, the dominant Introverted iNtuition needs to be well-supported
by the auxiliary Extraverted Feeling function.  If Extraverted Feeling
exists only to support the desires of Introverted iNtuition, then neither
function is being used to its potential.\nIntroverted iNtuition is a personality function that constantly gathers
information, and sees everything from many different perspectives.  As
the dominant player in a personality, it has the effect of constantly
bombarding the psyche with new information to consider.  
Introverted iNtuition is sort of like a framework for understanding that
exists in the mind.  As something is perceived, it is melded into the
existing intuitive framework.  If an entirely new piece of information
is perceived by the Introverted iNtuitive, that person must redefine
their entire framework of reference.
So, Introverted iNtuitives are constantly taking in information about
the world that needs to be processed in a relatively lengthy manner in
order to be understood.  That presents quite a challenge to the INFJ.
It's not unusual for an INFJ to feel overwhelmed with all of the things
that he or she needs to consider in order to fully understand an idea or
situation.\nWhen Introverted iNtuition dominates the INFJ such that the other functions
cannot serve their own purposes, we find the INFJ cutting off information
that it needs to consider.  If the psyche is presented with information that 
looks anything like something that Introverted iNtuition has processed
in the past, it uses Extraverted Feeling to quickly reject that information.
The psyche uses Extraverted Feeling to reject the ideas, rather than taking
the information into its intuitive framework, and therefore potentially
causing that framework to be reshaped and redefined.\nUsing Extraverted Feeling in this manner may effectively serve the immediate
needs of Introverted iNtuition, but it is not ideal.  It causes the INFJ
to not consider information that may be useful or criticial in developing
a real understanding of an issue.  It may cause the INFJ to come off as
too strongly opinionated or snobbish to others.\nThe better use of Extraverted Feeling for an INFJ would be to use it
to assess the INFJ's rich insights and weigh them against the external
world.  When the INFJ personality uses Extraverted Feeling to cut off
incoming information, rather than to judge internal intuitions, it is
effectively cheating itself. It's like getting the answers to a test
without having to really understand the questions.  It's easier to get
the answer right away, rather than to have to figure everything out.
For the INFJ, who has a tremendous amount of information and "studying"
that needs to be done, it's very tempting to take shortcuts.  Most
INFJs will do this to some extent.  The real problems occur when an
INFJ personality has become so imbalanced that its owner is extremely
self-important and rarely consider anyone else's opinions or ideas.\nSolutions\nTo grow as an individual, the INFJ needs to focus on applying their
judgment to things only after they have gone through their intuition.
In other words, the INFJ needs to consciously try not to use their
judgment to dismiss ideas prematurely.  Rather, they should use their
judgment against their own ideas.  One cannot effectively judge
something that they don't understand.  The INFJ needs to take things
entirely into their intuition in order to understand them.  It may be
neccesary to give your intuition enough time to work through the new
information so that it can rebuild its global framework of understanding.
INFJs need to focus on using their judgment not to dismiss ideas, but
rather to support their intuitive framework.\nAn INFJ who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention
to the subject of their judgments, and their motivation for making
judgments.  Are they judging something external to themself, or are
they judging something that they have sifted through their intuition?
Is the motivation for judging something to be able to understand its
usefulness in the world, or to dismiss it?  Too often, an INFJ will 
judge something without properly understanding it, and with the intention of
dismissing it.  Seek first to understand, then to judge.\nLiving Happily in our World as an INFJ\nSome INFJs have difficulty fitting into our society.  Their problems are
generally associated with not knowing (or caring) how they come across to
others, and with having unreasonable expectations for others' behaviors.
Both of these issues stem from using Extraverted Feeling primarily to
dismiss external ideas, rather than to sort through their own intuitions.\nAn INFJ who uses Extraverted Feeling in this diminished manner may become
so strongly opinionated that they form rigid and unreasonable expectations
for others.  They may feel so strongly about things that they become very
passionate and agitated when they feel that something has gone wrong.
In these cases, it's not uncommon for the INFJ to 
express their displeasure with biting sarcasm.  They become so emotionally
upset that they are generally not aware of how their behavior comes across
to others.  Even if the consequences of their attitude and behavior is
pointed out to them, they may be agitated to the point that they don't care.
This kind of situation can be devastating to the INFJ on many levels, and
should be avoided.  There isn't much that can be done once the INFJ has 
reached the point where they are too upset to care about others, but
the INFJ can prevent this problem from occuring by ensuring that they never
get to that point.\nHow can you, as an INFJ, ensure that you won't get that upset?  It
probably seems to you that these kinds of upsets are caused by external
circumstances and situations.  Well, that's not really true.  It's true
that things will happen over which you have no control.  But you certainly
have control over how you perceive these things, or more appropriately,
how you *judge* these things.\nSpecific suggestions:\nTake care to listen to someone's idea entirely before you pass
        judgment on it.  Ask questions if neccesary.  Do whatever it takes to
        make sure that you understand the idea.  Try not to begin judging anything
        about the idea until you have understood it entirely.\nBefore you begin talking to another person, pause for a moment and
        look at that person.  Take in that person's attitude and feelings at
        that moment.  Be aware of the person with whom you're speaking.\nIf you become upset, walk away immediately.  DO NOT express anger.
        When you get angry, you lose.  After you have calmed down, apologize for
        leaving and continue with what you were doing.\nTry to identify the personality type of everyone that you encounter
        frequently in your life.  Remember that people with the Sensing preference
        need to be communicated with in a direct, concise manner.  Speak plainly
        and simply with Sensors, giving "yes" or "no" answers.\nTry to be on good terms with all people, even those that you
        consider beneath you.  Try to understand that everybody has something 
        to offer.\nTen rules to live by to achieve INFJ success\nFeed your strengths!\nDo things that allow your
        brilliant intuition and service-oriented manner to flourish.\nFace your weaknesses!\nSee your weaknesses for
        what they are, and seek to overcome them.  Especially, strive to use 
        your judgment against your internal ideas and intuitions, rather than as
        a means of disregarding other people's ideas.\nTalk through your thoughts.\nYou need to step through
        your intuitions in order to put them into perspective.  Give yourself time
        to do this, and take advantage of discussing ideas with others.  You'll
        find externalizing your internal intuitions to be a valuable exercise.\nTake in everything.\nDon't dismiss ideas prematurely
        because you don't respect the person generating the ideas, or because you
        think you already know it all.  After all, everybody has something to offer,
        and nobody knows everything.  Steven Covey says it so well when he says:
        "Seek first to understand, and then to be understood."\nWhen you get angry, you lose.\nYour passion and intensity
        are strong assets, but can be very harmful if you allow yourself to fall
        into the "Anger Trap".  Remember that Anger is destructive to your personal
        relationships.  Work through your anger before you impress it upon others,
        or you will likely find yourself alone.  Disagreements and disappointments
        can only be handled effectively in a non-personal and dispassionate manner.\nKeep your eye on the Big Picture.\nWatch out for your
        tendency to become obsessed with details.  If you find yourself feeling
        very, very strongly about a small detail, take a big step back and make
        sure that you can still see the goal.  You're not going to get there if
        you get mired in the details.\nBe accountable for yourself.\nDon't blame the problems
        in your life on other people.  Look inwardly for solutions.  No one has
        more control over your life than you have.\nBe humble.\nJudge yourself at least as harshly as
        you judge others.\nAssume the best.\nDon't distress yourself and others
        by dwelling on the dark side of everything.  Just as there is a positive
        charge for every negative charge, there is a light side to every dark side.
        Remember that positive situations are created by positive attitudes.
        Expect the best, and the best will come forward.\nRelax!\nDo yourself a favor and learn how to effectively
        unwind.  Get exercise and restful sleep.  Take vacations.  Engage in 
        relaxing activities.
        Take care of yourself and your loved ones by learning to let go of your
        passion and intensity for a respite.\nMore resources\nINFJ\nProfile\nINFJ\nCareers\nINFJ\nRelationships\nType\nTheory\nx
