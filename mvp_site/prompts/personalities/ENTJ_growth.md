Heyward\nWhat does\nSuccess\nmean to an ENTJ?\nENTJ people are realists, in the most basic sense of the word. Not only because their thinking is based upon a clear view of how things actually are in the world around them, but also because their ideas and strategies are structured around those unambiguous, "down to earth", commonsense beliefs which sum up the obvious and undeniable in life. But while ENTJs might be pragmatic about the immediate situation before them, they are scarcely satisfied with it until it can be made more productive, useful or valuable. The ENTJ's reasoning on such matters is always clear and generally unemotional. If action can improve an item or a situation then it ought to be taken, and the ENTJ will always be found in the midst of such action, organizing, planning and leading the way forward until the best result possible has been realized. This makes success for an ENTJ something that can be clearly seen, a real world result which can be measured. And whether measured in dollars, bricks, bread or just happy people, the successful ENTJ knows the result is due to their belief that it is just plain commonsense to try and make the best of every situation and get the most out if it for the most people.\nAllowing your ENTJ strengths to flourish\nAs an ENTJ, you have gifts that are specific to your personality type
    that aren't natural strengths for other types. By recognizing your special
    gifts and encouraging their growth and development, you will more readily see
    your place in the world, and be more content with your role.\nNearly all ENTJs will recognize the following characteristics in themselves.  They should embrace and nourish these strengths.\nAble to cut straight to the chase in any situation and not be sidetracked by non-essential issues\nA propensity for leadership which follows naturally from their ability to control and manage real time/real world situations\nA talent for factual analysis unbiased by prejudice or emotion.\nA "can do" approach to life which makes the working environment a positive place for them\nA strong regard for positive social and economic institutions, structure and government\nSecond to none time and space management skills, everything is organized and in its place\nAble to constantly synthesize and adapt new ideas and concepts into strategies for business, social, financial or environmental development\nENTJs who have a well-developed Introverted Intuitive function to complement their dominant Extraverted Thinking will enjoy these special gifts:\nA talent for creating great benefits through the addressing of social justice issues\nThe ability to recognize and mediate their potentials in accord with the expectations of others\nAn approach to life which includes an awareness of the differences between their needs and those of others\nAble to know when to stop and take stock of life and recognize the qualities of the moment\nA talent for showing others the way to get past difficulties in their outer life\nPotential problem areas\nWith any gift of strength, there is an associated weakness. Without
  "bad", there would be no "good". Without
  "difficult", there would be no "easy". We value our
  strengths, but we often curse and ignore our weaknesses. To grow as a person
  and get what we want out of life, we must not only capitalize upon our
  strengths, but also face our weaknesses and deal with them. That means taking a
  hard look at our personality type's potential problem areas.\nENTJs are strong, right minded and rational
people. This should be kept in mind as you read some of the more negative
material about ENTJ weaknesses. These weaknesses are natural. We
offer this information to enact positive change, rather than as blatant
criticism.\nMost of the weaker
characteristics in the ENTJ stem from their dominant Extraverted Thinking
function overtaking their personality, stifling the natural expression and
balancing value of the other personality functions. In such cases, an ENTJ may show
some or all of the following weaknesses in varying degrees.\nMay be unable to understand other people's needs where these differ from their own.\nMay unwisely assume their ideas are the only right ones and are therefore being
fully implemented by others.\nMay become childishly petulant or angered when confronted by situations which
require feeling judgments.\nMay become so engrossed in a plan or ambition that personal needs and the needs of
others are forgotten.\nMay take every decision not made in agreement with their rational beliefs as a
personal rejection.\nMay be easily taken in or manipulated by others via agreement with their rational
attitudes.\nMay become obsessed with small obstructions and difficulties to the point where the
overall plan is forgotten\nMay believe natural limitations are actually ailments which ought to be eradicated\nMay assume others are ever plotting against\nMay believe only their own view of the world or a
situation is correct, even to the point that they make it into a kind of dogma
which must be followed by those around them.\nAdvertisment\nExplanation of problems\nMost of the problems described
above can be seen as a direct result of a too dominant Extraverted Thinking
function ruling the personality. In most cases this is exactly what is
happening, but it is also worth recognizing that some of the weaknesses in the\nENTJ's\npersonality that are more apparent to other Types,
flow not so much from the excesses of the\nENTJ's\ndominant function, but from the natural inferiority of their feeling function
and its lack of adaptation. We must also recognize that the level of expression
of all functions in all people is variable and that some of the problems
discussed here apply only to strongly expressing\nENTJ's\n,
where the attitude which flows from using Extraverted Thinking exclusively to
guide them through life creates its own particular problems.\nThe over-dominance of
Extraverted Thinking leads to an intensely intellectual way of seeing the
world, where values such as right and wrong, good and bad, useful and useless
are judged only by their applicability to an almost mathematically exact - and
to the ENTJ - always rational, attitude to life. Without the balance provided
by other ways of seeing or judging, the ENTJ is unable to account for actions
based upon the inner views or feeling behavior of others, hence such things are
always judged negatively, either as irrelevant - or at best - as being of small
consequence. Additionally, with their thinking attitude always turned outward
and totally subject to the world beyond their senses, without the balance of
some internally felt objectivity the ENTJ will often follow their ideas and
ambitions without consideration for their own physical and emotional needs.
Indeed, the ENTJ often feels that if only his project, his work, his outer
reality would just fall into line with his own rational views then all would be
well within his world and all his needs would be met. Unfortunately such an
attitude can never be satisfied, for the world is not only rational, but also
full of situations and human behavior which must be appreciated and understood
by quite different, and again - to the ENTJ - often seemingly absurd
criteria.\nA healthy personality needs to
have a good balance between its dominant and auxiliary functions. For an ENTJ,
dominant Extraverted Thinking needs to be well-supported by their auxiliary
Introverted Intuitive function. If Introverted Intuition exists only to support
the intellectual rationale created by Extraverted Thinking, then neither function
is being used to its full potential.\nIntroverted Intuition is the ENTJ's
access to their inner world, to the information that
could tell them how the world is affecting them. Because it is introverted, its
images arise from the subjective depths of the mind, and contain all that the
ENTJ has not considered within their strictly rational and object oriented view
of the world. Introverted Intuition provides the personally biased information
the ENTJ needs to balance this world view and protect the ENTJ from being
totally swallowed up by their selfless and yet single minded attachment to
facts, figures and a rationale they accept only from the world outside
themselves. Because this inner information is often opposed to the\nENTJ's\nstrongly held ideas it is often rejected, or if
accepted, turned outward to make negative judgments about external situations
or the behavior of others, rather than seen as a corrective balance to the 
ENTJ's own attitudes and behavior.\nSolutions\nTo grow as an individual, the
ENTJ needs to recognize the role Intuition plays in their life, and learn to
understand its language. In particular the ENTJ needs to realize that their
intuitive function is not directed outward to the world, that its images are
personal, subjective and relate directly to the way the ENTJ's
inner self is being affected by both the outside world and their own behavior.\nIntroverted Intuition is not an
obvious process to understand, and quite unlike the rational, straightforward
thinking the ENTJ is used to. Nevertheless, if understood and fully utilized to
support thinking, it can make the ENTJ the most outwardly effective and
productive of all the personality types. For this reason it is essential to
allow this gift to become what it can be, rather than limiting its talents and
allowing it only to speak when it seems to agree with the\nENTJ's\noutwardly focused thinking. Below are a few specific suggestions to help you
apply Introverted Intuition.\nWhen confronted by a situation which requires an important decision, try to put it
       off for long enough to be able to sit quietly with it. In doing so allow
       yourself to feel and see the images which arise in your mind regarding this
       situation. Try to set aside those which appear immediately as the products of
       your own beliefs and thinking, and regard the others closely. If these images
       and ideas were the opinions of people whose judgment you trusted implicitly,
       try to question them in your mind and find the reasons why they consider things
       in such a way.\nThere are some people around you who always seem to know just which way to go or how
       things work or what the outcome of a certain situation will be without them
       seeming to have sufficient information to be able to do so. These people are
       intuitive types and their world is full of possibilities which they can
       immediately recognize as apt to certain situations. You also have this talent,
       but you have a habit of not following it, rather you prefer to think it out and
       find the options which "ought" to be correct. I placed ought in quotes for a
       very good reason here, for you know yourself how often things have developed in
       the direction you had an inkling of, but refused to accept without thinking.
       Try to let these immediate impressions have their moment and recognize them as
       true possibilities which ought to be examined more closely. Understand that
       they are not baseless images and ideas but rely upon valid sources of
       information which you simply screen out of your life by habit.
