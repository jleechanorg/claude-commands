  they do by a desire to understand the world around them.
  They are constantly searching about, mentally
  and physically, for input that will help them to better understand the Big
  Picture.  They are open-minded to new
  people and new experiences; they're eager for the opportunity to understand
  what the new people and experiences are all about.
  ENFPs use their
  understanding of the world to serve the agendas of their value systems.
  An ENFP's value
  system often includes respect for the needs and desires of individual people
  over the needs of a social group.  Their
  respect for the individual makes them dislike controlling others, and being
  controlled by others.
  ENFPs are passionate about their beliefs, whatever they may
  be.  They often stubbornly adhere to
  their value system regardless of threats to its validity.
  They are more concerned with keeping true to
  what they believe than they are with expectations or demands from the social
  group that they function within.
  ENFPs dislike personal criticism, because it threatens
  their validity as an individual and the validity of their value system.
  ENFPs may
  internalize anger rather than express it; their respect for other individuals
  makes it difficult for them to hurt others. An ENFP's
  feeling of success depends upon the
  availability of opportunities to grow their understanding of the world, upon
  feeling that they're living true to their personal value system, and upon the condition
  of their closest relationships.\nAllowing your ENFP strengths to flourish\nAs an ENFP, you have gifts that are specific to your personality type
    that aren't natural strengths for other types. By recognizing your special
    gifts and encouraging their growth and development, you will more readily see
    your place in the world, and be more content with your role.\nNearly all ENFPs will recognize the following characteristics in themselves.  They should embrace and nourish these strengths:\nThey're exceptionally perceptive about people and situations.  
           They're often able to quickly and accurately assess where someone is coming from.\nThey accept and value people as individuals, and are strongly egalitarian.  
          They believe that individuals have the right to be themselves, and are very tolerant and accepting of most people.\nThey're often deep and intelligent, and may be quite brilliant in their ability to tie things together.  
          They're wired to look for connections in the external world, and so may mentally put things together more easily than many.\nTheir interest in understanding the world usually makes them in tune with what's socially acceoptable and what isn't.  
          This may help them to be popular and likable.\nThey're highly creative.  This ability may be used in an artistic way, or may be used to generate ideas and new ways of thinking.\nENFPs who have developed their Introverted Feeling to the extent that they apply judgment to all of their perceptions will enjoy these special gifts:\nThey will have the ability to follow through on projects they've begun.\nThey will be less gullible and malleable, and generally more able to discern between "good" and "bad", rather than accepting everything without question.\nThey may be highly artistic.\nThey will have the ability to focus and concentrate deeply on tasks.  This enhanced ability to think and process information internally will make them more capable on many levels.\nThey will balance out their desire to meet new people and have new experiences with the desire to put their understanding to use in some way.\nThey will find more meaning and purpose in their lives.\nPotential problem areas\nWith any gift of strength, there is an associated weakness. Without
  "bad", there would be no "good". Without
  "difficult", there would be no "easy". We value our
  strengths, but we often curse and ignore our weaknesses. To grow as a person
  and get what we want out of life, we must not only capitalize upon our
  strengths, but also face our weaknesses and deal with them. That means taking a
  hard look at our personality type's potential problem areas.\nMost of the weaker characteristics found in ENFPs
  are due to their dominant Extraverted Intuition overshadowing
  the personality to the extent
  that they don't apply judgement to anything.
  Or, they may use their primary judging function (Introverted Feeling) to
  support the agenda of Extraverted Intuition, i.e. to rationalize and support
  the idea of welcoming all experiences and accepting all individuals.
  In such cases, an ENFP may show some or all
  of the following weaknesses in varying degree:\nMay be what many would call a "sucker" - vulnerable to schemers and con artists.\nMay get themselves into dangerous situations because they are too eager to push the envelope of their understanding, and not willing to apply judgment to anything.\nMay feel intense anger towards people who criticise them or try to control them, but will be unable to express the anger.  Left unexpressed, the anger may fester, simmer, and become destructive.\nMay blame their problems on other people, using logic and ration to defend themselves against the world.\nMay develop strong negative judgments that are difficut to unseat against people who they perceive have been oppressive to them.\nMay get involved with drugs, alcohol, or promiscuity, and generally seek mindless experiences and sensations.\nMay skip from relationship to relationship without the ability to commit.\nMay start projects but be unable to finish them.\nMay be unable to keep a job for any length of time.\nExplanation of problems\nNearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be
  attributed in various degrees to the common ENFP problem of wanting to
  understand and experience everything at any cost.
  If the ENFP does not learn how to
  discriminate things and people in their external environment, the ENFP will
  begin to use their judging function (Introverted Feeling) as a "rubber
  stamper" to support their agenda to seek out experiences.  This is a natural
  survivalistic technique for the ENFP personality. 
  The main driver to the ENFP personality is
  Extraverted Intuition, whose purpose is to understand the world as one Big
  Picture, seeking connections and meaning in everything.
  If their ability to seek understanding is
  threatened, the ENFP shuts out the threatening force.
  This is totally natural, but unfortunately
  the individual who exercises this type of agenda protection regularly will
  become more and more unable to apply objective judgment to anything.
  When the unbalanced ENFP does apply
  judgement, it will generally be skewed to support their subjective agenda.
  They will always find justification for their
  own inappropriate behaviour.  They will
  be unable to finish anything that they start, and generally wander through life
  from experience to experience.\nIt's very common for ENFPs to resist applying
  judgement until they feel they truly understand a person or situation.
  However, part of the understanding process
  includes using discernment to classify qualities.
  If the ENFP shuts judgment off entirely, he
  or she will not achieve their ultimate goal of understanding; rather they will
  jump from experience to experience in a purposeless fashion.\nAnger can be a problem for anybody, but may be especially so for ENFPs
  who have not sufficiently developed their Introverted
  Feeling.  The desire to keep everything
  non-judgmental, combined with the tendency to use Introverted Feeling as
  justification rather than true judgement is a recipe for suppressed anger.
  These are very contradictory forces.
  "I hate you for judging me" is an ironic
  feeling, but is unfortunately common.  The
  inability to apply judgment, or to accept negative judgment, makes it difficult for the
  ENFP to express anger, as anger often comes with negative judgment in tow.  Therefore,
  the ENFP stews in their anger, rather than dealing with it.\nSolutions\nTo grow as an individual, the ENFP needs to focus on applying judgement
  to all of their perceptions. This means they need to decide how they really
  feel about people, places and things, rather than allowing their feelings to
  hang open indeterminately.  The ENFP
  needs to understand that developing their ability to discern qualities does not
  threaten their ability to understand the world, but rather enhances it, and
  enhances their personal changes for achieving a measure of success in their
  lives.\nThe ENFP concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to
  their motivation for making a judgment. Are they trying to really determine
  the objective value or merit of something, or are they trying to defend their
  individual right to not be judged or controlled?
  The goal when judging something is to not let your life experiences cloud your opinions.
  Obviously, this is not entirely possible, but it is the exercise to keep
  in mind.  You want to open your mind to
  judgment without feeling threatened, and without using your own judgement in a
  defensive, rationalizing mode.\nLiving happily in our world as an ENFP\nAs can be seen from the above, some ENFPs can
  have difficulty fitting into society. Their problems are often due top feeling
  different from others because of their dominant Intuition, and being unable to
  stick to anything long enough to feel a sense of accomplishment.
  They feel like they don't fit in, and can't
  find the place where they belong in the world.
  The ENFP who consistently makes decisions and applies classifications to
  their ideas will be able to turn their ideas into reality, and experience the
  feelings of accomplishment and success that accompany being effective.\nThe key to personal growth for the ENFP is competent execution of
  Introverted Feeling. It's difficult for most to understand what this means,
  much less incorporate that directive into your life.  I have created some action-oriented
  suggestions that will help lead you down the path towards more effective use of
  the Introverted Feeling function. Specific suggestions:\nWhen you feel angry or resistant toward
      someone who you feel is criticizing you, take this as a cue that you are not
      judging effectively.  When that happens,
      take a step back from your anger and try to really hear what the person is
      saying objectively.  Rather than
      expending mental energy in defining how the other person is wrong, try to judge
      what the person is actually saying, without respect to yourself.\nPeriodically make lists of goals and
      accomplishments.  Revisit your goals and
      accomplishments often to maintain a sense of direction.\nSpend time alone regularly for the
      purpose of thinking through issues in your life.
