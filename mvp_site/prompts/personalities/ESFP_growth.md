spontaneously grasp the moment, particularly if it offers a new sensation or
experience. And while the ESFP might seem to others to only be interested in
piling up new experiences, or reliving old ones just to savour the quality of
the sensations or lively enjoyment they bring, the ESFP has in fact a far more
subtle relationship to life and the world around them. Indeed, with their
curious mixture of Extraverted Sensation and Introverted Feeling, the ESFP can
show a wealth of complexity in their ways, even if to the ESFP themselves,
considering such matters is felt to be a tedious and - to their way of seeing
the world - quite unnecessary task.  For
this reason, just defining what success means to an ESFP requires more than
simply assuming that a life filled with satisfying, quality experiences
necessarily fulfills this criteria, as the ESFP's true needs and satisfactions
will depend greatly on the strength and refinement of their Sensation and
Feeling functions. But there is one thing that defines all ESFP's, and that is
their exuberant abilty - and need - to engage with other people and express
that which grips them. So, whilst success might come through many different
paths, and be felt by the ESFP in modes and preferences not necessarily
understood as success by other types, the successful ESFP will nevertheless
always be found where they can live in full and open engagement with people and
able to express their talents, appreciations and joys before the world at large.\nAllowing your ESFP strengths to flourish\nAs an ESFP, you have gifts that are specific to your personality type
    that aren't natural strengths for other types. By recognizing your special
    gifts and encouraging their growth and development, you will more readily see
    your place in the world, and be more content with your role.\nNearly all ESFPs will recognize the following characteristics in themselves.  They should embrace and nourish these strengths:\nA great ability to understand the objective world, its facts and realities\nA talent for entertaining and pleasing others with words and actions\nAn aptitude for getting the most out of any situation or place\nVery skilled at finding the best of things for themselves and others\nA warm and generous attitude both as a giver and receiver\nExceptional natural musical and dramatic skills\nA detailed and finely nuanced appreciation of the outside world\nAdept at detecting and recognising the effects of minute changes to their environment\nA talent for learning to do practically anything by just watching and doing\nA reassuring and practical sense of the world which supports others\nESFPs who have developed their
Introverted Feeling to the extent that they can integrate the concrete world of
their perceptions with a responsive and healthy system of personal values will
find that they enjoy these special gifts:\nTheir refined tastes will make it a joy for others to be in their company and homes.\nTheir abilty to weigh the value of their actions gives great force
           to their talent for entertaining people of all tastes.\nThey will quickly differentiate between those things which are of
           greater and lesser importance to a situation.\nThey will not just seek entertainment and things for their own
           sake, but will seek always to find that which they feel will provide the
           most value and reward for themselves and others.\nThe ESFP who augments their ability to recognize opportunities
           (Extraverted Sensing) with a strong internal value system (Intoverted
           Feeling) will find themselves more likely to attract, and be attracted
           into, very rewarding relationships with others -
           particularly with those of the opposite sex.\nThey will recognise and promote the talents of others.\nThey can be counted on to defend the best and most life promoting
           aspects of the world.\nPotential problem areas\nWith any gift of strength, there is an associated weakness. Without
  "bad", there would be no "good". Without
  "difficult", there would be no "easy". We value our
  strengths, but we often curse and ignore our weaknesses. To grow as a person
  and get what we want out of life, we must not only capitalize upon our
  strengths, but also face our weaknesses and deal with them. That means taking a
  hard look at our personality type's potential problem areas.\nESFPs are kind and creative
beings with many special gifts. I would like for the ESFP to keep in mind some
of the many positive things associated with being an ESFP as they read some of
this more negative material. Also remember that the weaknesses associated with
being an ESFP are natural to your type. Although it may be depressing to read
about your type's weaknesses, please remember that we offer this information to
enact positive change. We want people to grow into their own potential, and to
live happy and successful lives.\nMost of the weaker
characteristics that are found in ESFPs are due to their dominant Extraverted
Sensing function overshadowing the rest of their personality. When this
function smothers everything else, the ESFP can't use Introverted Feeling to
properly judge the value and propriety of their perceptions or actions. The
first ten of the following weaknesses derive in varying degrees from this
problem alone, whilst the rest are due to the additional effect of the ESFPs
unique make up and result from their diminished capacity to use abstract reasoning.\nMay be seen by others as unnecessarily coarse in their behaviour
     and life choices.\nMay be unable to value or may ignore the preferences and needs of others.\nMay perceive even the most careful and objective criticism as
     simply a ploy to spoil their enjoyment of life.\nMay have skewed or unrealistic ideas about the feelings of others.\nMay be unable to acknowledge or hear anything that would lead to
     second thoughts or a more careful appreciation.\nMay blame their problems on the world at large, seeing themselves
     as frustrated heroes battling against the odds.\nMay become totally self-focused and
     oblivious to the havoc they wreak on others feelings.\nMay uncaringly use totally innapropriate social behavior simply to make a point.\nMay be overbearing in their judgements upon the taste and dress of others.\nMay come across to others as boastful and rash in their attitudes.\nMay rationalise the ways of the world in the most inane or
     simplistic ways.\nMay believe the most extraordinary things about inanimate objects
     and their workings.\nMay feel overwhelmed with tension and stress when driven into a
     situation which requires deep and careful consideration.\nUnder great stress, may feel the world around them is alive with
     dark, unseen influences.\nAnother difficulty, which is not so much a problem for the ESFP but for those around them,
particularly if Introverted Thinking or Intuitive types, is that even when
joyful or in the midst of life, they may be percieved as coldly self absorbed
and oblivious to the feelings of others, even when the truth is quite the
reverse. Should it somehow matter, then when in the company of such people, the
ESFP should take some trouble to express their feelings and value
judgements.\nExplanation of problems\nNearly all of the problematic
characteristics described above can be attributed in various degrees to the
common ESFP problem of being overly absorbed by the sensations and immediate apparent
facts of the external world. ESFPs are usually very spontaneous and outgoing
people who have little time for analysis of the complexities behind the world
they live in. They are likely to treat any point of view other than their own
rather shortly, waving away in particular the more intellectual and intuitive
understandings of others as irrelevant and totally secondary to the obvious
realities of life. If the ESFP does not learn how to deal with the tension that
arises between, what to them, is the most obvious and satisfying way to deal
with the\nworld,\nand those deeper intricacies which lie
behind its facade, the ESFP will begin to shut out any incoming information
which produces this tension. This is a natural survival technique for the ESFP
personality. The main driver to the ESFP personality is Extraverted Sensation,
whose purpose is solely to perceive the realities of the external world and by
which the ESFP orients themselves towards the things they need or desire. If an
ESFP's image of the world is threatened by demands for careful judgement or
reasoning, the ESFP shuts out the demand in order to preserve and honor their
world view. This is totally natural, and works well to protect the individual
psyche from getting hurt. However, the ESFP who exercises this type of
self-protection regularly will become not only more and more careless of other
people's needs and perspectives, but also cut off in a world where the facts
and realities which they perceive become interwoven with a belief system which
supports only the ESFPs desire driven view. Under such circumstances they will
justify their own inappropriate behaviors in the most astounding or rationally
simplistic ways, and will always find fault with others for trying to
complicate and disturb what ought to be a simple and obvious way of life. It
will be difficult for them to maintain close personal relationships because
they will not only have unreasonable and simplistically concrete expectations,
but will be unable to understand why such expectations cannot be easily met.\nIt's not an uncommon tendency for the ESFP
to look to their inner world only for feelings that justify their desires and
perceptions. However, if this tendency is given free reign, the resulting ESFP
personality is too self-centered to be happy or successful. Since the ESFP's
dominant function is Extraverted Sensing, they must balance this with an
auxiliary Introverted Feeling function which is sufficiently refined to make
reasonably objective judgements about the value of the ESFPs actions and the
people and things in their life. The ESFP makes value judgements via
Introverted Intuition. This is also the ESFP's primary way of dealing with\ntheir own\ninternal subjective world. If the ESFP uses
Introverted Feeling only to serve the purposes of Extraverted Sensing, then the
ESFP is not using Introversion effectively at all. As a result, the ESFP does
sufficiently consider the effects of their actions and perceptions sufficiently
for a strong value system to arise in their personality. They see nothing but
the joys, satisfactions and sensations of the world outside themselves, and
deal with feeling only so far as it supports their need for constant
stimulation and gratification. These individuals can often come across as
coarse and lustful, although can just as easily seem the complete opposite, as
refined and tasteful connoisseurs who, nevertheless, at closer quarters reveal
their complete indifference to anything but the satisfaction of their own
desires.\nAt this point, I would like the
reader to understand that, as with all personality types, serious problems are
usually only encountered by those whose dominant function is unusually strongly
expressed against the other functions. Such situations are rare and although
the problems discussed here can indeed be felt to some level by all ESFPs, most
people regardless of their personality type tend toward a balance within both
their personal and worldly relationships which occurs despite differences in
personality preference; a balance driven by the need for comfort in others and
the human capacity for love. So whilst it is essential for us to fine tune our
relationships through knowledge and understanding of our differences and
peculiar needs, it is also good for us to remember that the most simple and
childlike longings of the heart can also be most powerful guides to
happiness.\nSolutions\nTo grow as an individual, the
ESFP needs to focus on increasing their self understanding to allow a rational
and more objectively reasoned value system to arise within themselves. In order
for the ESFP to more validly judge the the value of their desires, actions and
the things they allow into their world, the ESFP needs to know that their world
view is not being threatened but qualitatively reinforced by the strength and
objectivity of their judgements. The ESFP must consciously tell himself/herself
that a feeling that does not agree with their desires or perceptions of the
world is not an indictment of their character but a clue to greater
understanding.\nThe ESFP who is concerned with personal
growth will pay close attention to their motivation for valuing certain
actions, interests and possessions over others. Do they attend to their
feelings to judge such things according to a strong set of values which accords
also with the needs of others? Or, do they judge only to support a personal
desire? At the moment when something is felt, is the ESFP concerned with
adjusting that feeling to fit in with what appears to them as the most
important things in the world? Or is she/he concerned with allowing their
feelings to be fully realised? To achieve a better understanding of their
feelings, the ESFP should try to allow feelings their full force, before
setting them against their strong desires. They should be consciously aware of
their tendency to discard anything that doesn't agree with their immediate
sense of appearance, and work towards lessening this tendency. They should try
to see situations from other people's perspectives, without making personal
judgments about the situations or the other people's perspectives. In general,
they should work on exercising their Feeling in a truly Introverted
sense. In other words, they should use Feeling to understand how the world of
their perceptions affects their inner life, using it to discover the values
that truly matter, rather than simply to support their wishes. The ESFP who
successfully creates a strong value system can be quite a powerful force for
positive change.\nLiving Happily in our World as an ESFP\nSome ESFPs have difficulty
fitting into our society. Their problems are often a result of an uncaring
attitude to anything other than the moment, an unawareness of the needs of
others, or too simplistic a set of expectations. All of these issues stem from
using Introverted Feeling in a diminished manner. An ESFP who uses feeling to
judge the value of their perceptions and actions, rather than one who uses it
only to support their desires, will have a clearer, more refined appreciation
of the world and what it can offer. He or she will also be more aware of how
others may feel, and will have more realistic expectations for others' behavior
within a relationship. Such well-adjusted ESFPs will fit happily into our
society.\nUnless you really understand
Psychological Type and the nuances of the various personality functions, it's a
difficult task to suddenly start to use Feeling in an\nIntroverted\ndirection. It's difficult to even understand what that means, much less to
incorporate that directive into your life. For the ESFP, the most important
thing is to recognise and understand that Feelings must not be confused with
sensations or the emotions they unleash. Quite often we say "it feels good"
when we really mean that the sensation we are experiencing is good. The sense
of "Feeling" from a psychological viewpoint is that it underlies that rational,
judging factor which discriminates rightness or applicability from wrongness or
misapplication, guilt from pride etc. With this in mind, I am providing some specific
suggestions that may help you to begin exercising your Introverted Feeling:\nWhen a new prospect enters your life and stirs your appetite, sit
     with it for a moment in your mind and allow yourself to notice whether you
     have a lurking judgement about it. Try to allow this judgement to come
     forward on its own behalf and do not try to rationalise it nor be afraid
     of it. Imagine that you are hearing this judgement from the lips of
     another person, or perhaps from God, anything to let it be felt
     objectively within your mind. What is your Feeling function saying about what
     your exciting new prospect really means to you?\nThink of a situation in your life in which you are sharing your
     joys and enthusiasms with others, perhaps entertaining them. Perhaps you
     are an entertainer. Watch the looks and body language of others as you
     speak or perform and notice that not all seem to be offering the same emtional
     responses to your words or actions. Each one is feeling you a different
     way, judging you a different way. Try to notice the same function within
     yourself now, the responsive person within you who is also judging your
     words and actions. How is he/she reacting to you?\nWhen having a conversation with a friend or relative, dedicate at
     least half of your time to discovering their values and reasons.
     Concentrate on really understanding why they feel as they do. Ask
     questions, and take some time later to ask those same questions of
     yourself.\nThink of the people who are closest to you. As you think of each
     person, tell yourself "this person has their own life going on, and
     they are more concerned with their own life than they are with mine."
     Remember that this doesn't mean that they don't care about you. It's the
     natural order of things. Try to visualize what that person is doing right
     now. What are they feeling, what judgements are they possibly making about
     what is happpening to them? Don't compare their situation to your 
     own,just try to discover how you would feel in their
     situation.\nTry to identify the personality type of everyone that you come
     into contact with for any length of time.\nTen rules to live by to achieve ESFP success\nFeed your strengths!\nEncourage your natural expressive
        abilities and hands-on talents. Nourish your appreciation of the world. Give
        yourself opportunities to enjoy life to the full.\nFace your weaknesses!\nRealize and accept that some traits are
        strengths and some are weaknesses. Facing and dealing with your weaknesses
        doesn't mean that you have to change who you are, it
        means that you want to be the best You possible. By facing your weaknesses, you
        are honoring your true self, rather than attacking yourself.\nExpress your feelings.\nDon't let worries build up inside of
        you. If you are troubled by doubt or fear, tell\nthose close\nto you who will listen and offer counsel. Don't make the mistake of "blipping
        over it" or "sorting it out" some quick fix way.\nListen to everything.\nTry not to accept everything at face
        value. Let everything soak in and listen to your feelings.\nSmile at criticism.\nRemember that people will not always
        agree with you or understand you, even if they value you greatly. Try to see
        disagreement and criticism as an opportunity for growth. In fact, that is
        exactly what it is.\nBe aware of others.\nRemember that there are 15 other
        personality types out there who see things differently than you see them. Try
        to identify other people's types. Try to understand their perspectives.\nBe accountable for yourself.\nRemember that your
        every word and action affects those around you, so it is important for you to
        be fully responsible for your self, and to the values you hold.\nBe gentle in your expectations.\nYou will always be disappointed with
        others if you expect too much of them. Being disappointed with another person
        is the best way to drive them away. Treat others with the same gentleness that
        you would like to be treated with.\nAssume the best.\nDon't distress yourself by assuming the worst.
        Remember that a positive attitude creates positive situations.\nWhen in doubt, ask questions!\nIf something seems to be wrong and you
        can't put your finger on it, maybe someone else can. Remember, there are many
        ways of seeing the world, and perhaps someone else's way will reveal the truth.\nMore resources\nESFP\nProfile\nESFP\nCareers\nESFP\nRelationships\nType\nTheory\nx
