Heyward\nWhat does\nSuccess\nmean to an ENTP?\nENTP personalities are motivated by possibilities. They love the outside chances; the new or unusual combinations lurking within the ordinary everyday world of things and ideas. For them, something is always on the up, something is always tantalizing their desire to re-orchestrate life into new patterns and shapes; new ways of fulfilling what can be as strong as a never ending desire to beat the odds and win at every game in town, or as mild as a quirky personal need for constant variety and change. With their thinking tied to the myriad possibilities they see in the world, they act swiftly and decisively upon those angles, choices and combinations scarcely noticed by other types, but through which they can build whole new frameworks or completely redefine an existing external situation in such a way that it appears new, revitalized and once again full of promise. Sameness, stasis, conservatism - even daily routine - can be loathsome to fervent ENTPs, whose drive is always to be into something new, different and full of fresh possibilities, and who, given the opportunity, will always be the first to show others a new path to success in a venture, or to find a way of doing something that no-one has done before.\nENTP people measure their success by their "aha" moments, by the sense of satisfaction which comes as they spread their newly written maps before them and contemplate the new adventure, design, investigation or conquest which has now become their road ahead. What has gone before, previous achievements, ways of living - even people met along the way - are often now forgotten or considered passe, mere steps along a path which has now brought a new frontier to be exploited for its gifts. Whether it is the search for knowledge, money, power, fame or pleasure, the ENTP will be found at the frontline, gazing into the distance and discovering new avenues toward, bigger, better or more satisfying outcomes.\nAllowing your ENTP strengths to flourish\nAs an ENTP, you have gifts that are specific to your personality type
    that aren't natural strengths for other types. By recognizing your special
    gifts and encouraging their growth and development, you will more readily see
    your place in the world, and be more content with your role.\nNearly all ENTPs will recognize the following characteristics in themselves.  They should embrace and nourish these strengths:\nThe ability to hold many points of view in mind and see their differing merits.\nSeeing ways to do things others have not thought of.\nAble to give quick and diverse answers to any question of interest.\nSeeing the other side of a situation and making it known.\nBeing able to juggle many differing jobs or processes at the one time.\nEasily capable of holding your own in any argument or discussion.\nThe ability to quickly find the best or most useful side of others.\nSeeing the many connections between events and things which are not immediately obvious to others.\nENTPs who have developed their Introverted Thinking to the extent that they regularly and carefully interpret the information their 
    Extraverted Intuition brings to them will enjoy these special gifts:\nThe ability to solve puzzles and problems that have no obvious way to resolution.\nThe ability to define schematically a new structure or design and know it will work.\nKnowing and giving to others the very thing they need when they are not sure themselves.\nA talent for innovative creation in writing, music or the visual arts.\nThe gift of knowing which new ideas or changes will enhance rather than detract from their relationships with others\nPotential problem areas\nWith any gift of strength, there is an associated weakness. Without
  "bad", there would be no "good". Without
  "difficult", there would be no "easy". We value our
  strengths, but we often curse and ignore our weaknesses. To grow as a person
  and get what we want out of life, we must not only capitalize upon our
  strengths, but also face our weaknesses and deal with them. That means taking a
  hard look at our personality type's potential problem areas.\nMost of the weaker characteristics that are found in ENTPS are due to
their dominant function of Extraverted Intuition overtaking the personality to
the point that the other functions exist merely to serve its purposes. In such
cases, an ENTP may show some or all of the following weaknesses in varying
degrees.\nThe inability to maintain a comfortable situation or relationship once its possibilities have been realized or exhausted.\nA tendency to consider careful or meticulous thinkers as unworthy plodders or time wasters.\nBlindness to the needs and feelings of others not directly involved in the ENTP's current area of interest.\nA lack of sensitivity to the feelings and ways of those who might need reassurance, security or commitment.\nThe inability to deal carefully and calmly with the finer details of a situation or work in progress.\nTendency to become overly annoyed by minor setbacks or small things that have to be set right before the goal can be realized.\nA tendency to be arrogant or boastful, or to demean those who cannot see the same answers.\nCan often find themselves in bad situations by too quickly taking a big step forward or by being "too smart for their own good".\nExplanation of problems\nNearly all of the problematic
characteristics described above can be attributed in various degrees to the
common ENTP problem of being so fascinated with their Extroverted Intuitions
that they fail to develop a careful thinking process sufficient to balance it.
Leaps of perception, new ideas and strange but fascinating juxtapositions are
wonderful for the potential freshness and possible success they might bring.
But if not carefully appraised and chosen wisely they can also take us far from
the right path in life, take us from our friends, spoil our relationships and
even bring personal or financial disaster. Without a well developed thinking
function, the ENTP is always in danger of leaping over social, financial and
personal constraints for the sake of following a new vision. This might be as
simple as arousing the wrath of ones partner by suddenly deciding to by an
expensive gadget or change something around the house without being concerned
for their input or feelings, or as complex as allowing an ill considered
entrepreneurial idea lead them into financial and social disaster, simply
because the one sided vision of Extroverted Intuition does not recognize or
count the amount of small but important details which need to be right before
such ideas can be realized.\nWithout a solid thinking
function, the ENTP can easily discount or fail to notice the essential ethics
of social and interpersonal relationship, often considering themselves "above"
or untouched by such limiting values and often discounting the possibility that
their actions might be or hurtful or seen as unethical by others. It is not
that the one sided ENTP is deliberately hurtful, but simply ignorant of the
effects which can flow from their often compulsive need for change or need to
show how clever or individual they are. In the ENTP, the lack of a well
developed Feeling Function means that they must learn to\nunderstand\nfeeling
in both themselves and others and come to terms with its affects. This
understanding can only come from thinking carefully about the ways feeling
affects not only themselves, but others, and the importance others place on this
function. The ENTP has a feeling function more or less global in character and one
which does not judge fine differences. This inability to discriminate feelings
can allow the ENTP to say and do much that leaves others in the cold, so an
effort to think about the feeling process can be essential. Without the
understanding this brings, the ENTP can separate themselves from the ground of
their life, from the constancy of their friends and family and, without even
realizing it, they can easily find themselves in untenable positions where,
without support, they wonder why they are suddenly alone and lost.\nAnother significant problem
arises where the ENTP has grown within or is locked by circumstances to an
environment which limits their freedom or their ability to utilize their
specific abilities. This forces the ENTP to narrow down their intuitive process
to the point where it retains at least some freedom to operate within their
life. Under such conditions however, the intuition is free only to range over a
small and limited field of vision, a field which usually consists only of the
very things the ENTP is normally unconcerned about: the small details of life
and its familiar objects. Without the ability to take stock and apply careful
thought to the ways they might expand their horizons, the ENTP in such
situations can become morose, niggardly and obsessed with the most minor or
intangible details - to the point where such minutiae fill their life and each
day becomes a frustrating process of eliminating again and again the little
problems which ever seem to stand in the way of the "big picture" - a picture
which, as those around them know only too well, will never be realized.\nSolutions\nTo grow as an individual, the
ENTP needs to focus on carefully analyzing the information they receive via
their Extraverted Intuition. They need to allow themselves sufficient time and
space to relax with the ideas and possibilities they can see. It is all too
easy for the ENTP to assume that what they see is what they need. Careful
thinking can allow the ENTP to "suss out" the best
possible ways to proceed out of all the possibilities that come to them. At the
same time, even if they are not able to share them, ENTPs
need at least to understand the joys and satisfactions that others derive
within those situations the ENTP would not normally choose in life. Awareness
of the ways and needs of others can be the key to understanding the most life
affirming way ahead for the ENTP, for there is always a danger that they might choose
paths without regard to the feelings and needs of others close to them. The
ENTP learns from analyzing his experience, so the best way for the ENTP to grow
as a person is to develop his thinking capacity. Thus, that while the desire to
run out and do something "new" is an ENTP pattern of need, this need
must be integrated into a whole way of life in which the rest of our human
needs and those of others who rely upon our presence are also satisfied. Your
task, as a person interested in personal growth, is to understand yourself in a
truly objective fashion, and how you can best give to the world, rather than
just exploit the possibilities it bring to you.\nThe ENTP should always pay
close attention to why they are acting upon new information. Are they acting
out of a carefully considered motive to realize something truly worthwhile for
themselves and others? Are they really seeking to improve life, or concerned
with just making the next play, proving the point, showing others the moves or
climbing the mountain just because it is there to climb, regardless of the
consequences?\nLiving happily in the world as an ENTP\nThe problem ENTPs might have fitting into the world are not usually
directly related to friends or relationships. Rather, the ENTP has trouble
maintaining a stable and consistent lifestyle. While this can affect love
relationships, the ENTP usually has such an endearing and capable "way" about
them that others tend to follow their lead, even in the most trying of
situations. The problems the ENTP generates in life are those associated with
their constant need for individuality, excellence and new experiences which
test their talents. While this can place great demand upon relationships,
tensions are usually only apparent where the ENTP has made a love match with a
person whose security needs are greater than their ability to allow their ENTP
partner the freedom they need. The self aware ENTP must therefore not only be
careful in considering their career choices, but also in choosing a life
situation with a partner. Of all the types, the ENTP is most uncomfortable with
compromise and ought not to place themselves in situations which demand it.
Most importantly the ENTP must become aware, through careful analysis of 
experience, just what kind of changes for the good or bad have
been the direct result of their need for constant refreshment of life. Only through
this awareness will the ENTP be able to focus on those perceptions which
promise a better and more fruitful life.\nMost ENTPs will experience career/life frustration and some relationship difficulties
through their lives. The ENTP with well-developed Introverted Thinking will
find these times easier to deal with. Accordingly, we offer some general
suggestions for dealing with these difficulties, as well as some advice that
will help the ENTP develop their Introverted Thinking.\nTake time to really listen to the thoughts of others and try to
     see how they understand the world. Think about the ways in which your view
     of the world and your needs can mesh with theirs.\nDon't expect others to simply follow you or expect that they
     should see what you can see as a worthy goal. A good exercise is to
     imagine\nyourself\nas a blind or severely disabled
     person. Try to get the feel of what it would be like to have to organize
     your life from such a different perspective. Would your goals still be
     valid? Would they need re-thinking? Consider the possibility that while
     your way of thinking leads you to see other types as having limited vision
     or ability, the truth is that they are no more limited than yourself, but
     simply have a differing focus in life and differing needs.\nRealize and accept that for you a satisfying relationship will
     require you to attend to the small details of life and show an awareness
     of your partner's feelings. You might find this difficult, but it will pay
     the biggest dividends in return for your effort.\nExpanding your appreciation of the differences between people will
     expand your understanding of human expectations. Try to figure out the
     personality type of people that you know and encounter in your life.\nTake care to listen to what people express within different social
     and work situations. Notice the different ways they go about their
     dealings with others or solving their problems. Do not try to compare or
     judge their ways against your own, simply try to recognize the many ways
     it is possible to be at peace in the world.\nWhen having a conversation with a friend or relative, spend at
     least half of the time talking about them. Concentrate on really
     understanding where the person is coming from with their concerns. Ask
     questions.\nThink of the people who are closest to you. Remember that they
     have their own passions, satisfactions and needs. Try to visualize what
     that person is doing, and narrow down to how they are feeling at this
     moment; to one thing they might be thinking about. Don't pass judgment,
     just consider and reflect on why they might think or feel in just such a
     way.\nTen rules to live by to achieve ENTP success\nFeed your strengths!\nRealize your gift of seeing past the
        obvious brings you a great capacity to reward yourself and others through your cleverness.
        Make sure you engage in activities and which can expose this potential at its
        most valuable level.\nFace your weaknesses!\nWe all have weaknesses. Recognizing
        your weaknesses for what they are (without beating yourself up) will give you
        the power to change your life for the better.\nTalk through your perceptions.\nDiscussing what you see with others
        will them understand where you are coming from, and offer you the chance to
        discover the ways in which their input can balance your ideas.\nRelax and enjoy the view.\nTake the time to consider what you
        have, the gifts life has already brought to you. Try and discover the value and
        importance of those constant day to day things which support and nourish you.\nBe aware of others.\nUnderstand that everyone has their own
        lives and their own perspectives. Everyone has something to offer. Try to
        identify people's personality type.\nRecognize norms and structures are necessary.\nRemember that without the support and constancy of others, no-one can follow their dreams.
        The path you walk was laid by others, each of its stepping stones created to
        fulfill a different part of the human need for constancy and security. Without
        this support structure, you cannot go far.\nGet out of your comfort zone.\nUnderstand that the only way to grow is
        to get outside of your comfort zone. If you're feeling uncomfortable in
        situation because it seems to be going nowhere, that's good! That's an
        opportunity for growth.\nIdentify and express your feelings.\nYou may have a hard time understanding
        your feelings. It's important that you try to figure this out. Don't let people
        down. If you determine that you value a person, tell them so every time you
        think of it. This is the best way to make them feel secure in your affections,
        and so to promote a long-lasting relationship.\nBe accountable for yourself.\nRemember that no one has more control
        over your life than you have. Don't be a victim.\nAssume the best, but be wary.\nYour positive attitude nearly always
        creates positive situations. Just remember: to make them lasting and worthwhile
        you must build them on solid, carefully planned foundations.\nMore resources\nENTP\nProfile\nENTP\nCareers\nENTP\nRelationships\nType\nTheory\nx
