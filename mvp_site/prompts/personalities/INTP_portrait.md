deal with things rationally and logically.  Your secondary mode
is external, where you take things in primarily via your intuition.\nINTPs live in the world of theoretical possibilities.  They see everything
in terms of how it could be improved, or what it could be turned into.
They live primarily inside their own minds, having the ability to analyze
difficult problems, identify patterns, and come up with logical explanations.
They seek clarity in everything, and are therefore driven to build knowledge.
They are the "absent-minded professors", who highly value intelligence and the
ability to apply logic to theories to find solutions.  They typically
are so strongly driven to turn problems into logical explanations, that
they live much of their lives within their own heads, and may not place as much
importance or value on the external world.  Their natural drive to turn
theories into concrete understanding may turn into a feeling of personal
responsibility to solve theoretical problems, and help society move towards a
higher understanding.\nINTPs value knowledge above all else.  Their minds are constantly working
to generate new theories, or to prove or disprove existing theories.  They
approach problems and theories with enthusiasm and skepticism, ignoring
existing rules and opinions and defining their own approach to the
resolution.  They seek patterns
and logical explanations for anything that interests them.  
They're usually
extremely bright, and able to be objectively critical in their analysis.
They love new ideas, and become very excited over abstractions and theories.
They love to discuss these concepts with others.  They may seem dreamy 
and distant to others, because they spend a lot of time inside their minds
musing over theories.  They hate to work on routine things - they would
much prefer to build complex theoretical solutions, and leave the implementation
of the system to others.  They are intensely interested in theory, and will
put forth tremendous amounts of time and energy into finding a solution to
a problem that has piqued their interest.\nINTPs do not like to lead or control people.  They're very tolerant and
flexible in most situations, unless one of their firmly held beliefs has been
violated or challenged, in which case they may take a rigid stance.
The INTP is likely to be very shy when it comes to meeting new people.  On the
other hand, the INTP is self-confident and gregarious around people
they know well, or when discussing theories that they fully understand.\nThe INTP has no understanding or value for decisions made on the basis of
personal subjectivity or feelings.  They strive constantly to achieve
logical conclusions to problems, and don't understand the importance or
relevance of applying subjective emotional considerations to decisions.  For
this reason, INTPs are usually not in-tune with how people are feeling,
and are not naturally well-equiped to meet the emotional needs of others.\nThe INTP may have a problem with self-aggrandizement and social rebellion,
which will interfere with their creative potential.   Since their Feeling side
is their least developed trait, the INTP may have difficulty giving the
warmth and support that is sometimes necessary in intimate relationships.
If the INTP doesn't realize the value of attending to other people's
feelings, they may become overly critical and sarcastic with others.
If the INTP is not able to find a place for themself that supports the use of their strongest
abilities, they may become generally negative and cynical.  If the INTP
has not developed their Sensing side sufficiently, they may become unaware
of their environment, and exhibit weakness in performing maintenance-type
tasks, such as bill-paying and dressing appropriately.\nFor the INTP, it is extremely important that ideas and facts are expressed
correctly and succinctly.  They are likely to express
themselves in what they believe to be absolute truths.  Sometimes, their
well thought-out understanding of an idea is not easily understandable
by others, but the INTP is not naturally likely to tailor the truth so as to explain
it in an understandable way to others.  
The INTP may be prone to abandoning a project once they have figured it out,
moving on to the next thing.
It's important that the INTP place
importance on expressing their developed theories in understandable ways.
In the end, an amazing discovery means nothing if you are the only person
who understands it.\nThe INTP is usually very independent, unconventional, and original.  They
are not likely to place much value on traditional goals such as
popularity and security.  They usually have complex characters, and
may tend to be restless and temperamental.
They are strongly ingenious, and have unconventional thought patterns
that allow them to analyze ideas in new ways.  Consequently, a lot of
scientific breakthroughs in the world have been made by the INTP.\nThe INTP is at their best when they can work on their theories independently.
When given an environment that supports their creative genius and
possible eccentricity, the INTP can accomplish truly remarkable things.
These are the pioneers of new thoughts in our society.\n*Read about the INTP's Jungian type,\nIntroverted Thinking\n, or
