# Character Profile Template & Standard

**AI Directive: The Myers-Briggs Type (MBTI) is a core part of a character's identity. It must not be mentioned explicitly in the narrative, but it must subtly and consistently inform the character's thought processes, dialogue, and decisions. For example, an 'ISTJ' will be more likely to rely on past experiences and established rules, while an 'ENFP' will be more driven by exploring new possibilities and connecting with others on an emotional level. This is a foundational, non-negotiable aspect of roleplaying.**

This document defines the standard for the Player Character (PC) and all major Non-Player Character (NPC) personalities. The AI must ensure that character behavior, dialogue, and decisions are consistent with every field defined below.

## I. Core Identity
- **Name:**
- **Archetype/Role:** (e.g., Cynical Detective, Ambitious Sorceress, Reluctant Hero)
- **Occupation/Social Standing:**
- **D&D Alignment:** (e.g., Lawful Good, Chaotic Neutral. Note: This is a starting point and can change based on character actions and development.)
- **Myers-Briggs Type (MBTI):** [e.g., ISTP, ENFP] (Note: This trait is considered a fixed, core part of the character's personality.)

## II. Psychology & Personality
- **Core Motivation (The "Why"):** (What single desire, goal, or fear drives them above all else?)

- **Reputation:** (How are they generally perceived by others in the world?)

## IV. Backstory
- **Defining Moment:** (A key past event that shaped who they are today.)
- **Relevant History:** (A brief summary of their life leading up to the present.)

## VI. Example character

> **AI Directive:** This example represents the **required level of depth** for the Player Character and all significant NPCs. Use the *process and structure* of this example to create **new, unique characters** that are psychologically coherent. **Do not simply copy the specific traits of this example.** The goal is to replicate the *depth and detail*, not the *content*.
