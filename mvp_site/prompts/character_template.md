# Character Profile Template & Standard

**🚨 CRITICAL AI DIRECTIVE: Myers-Briggs (MBTI) and D&D Alignment are INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT TOOLS ONLY. Use these frameworks to create consistent character psychology but they must NEVER appear in any player-facing content including narrative text, character descriptions, or dialogue. Express personality through specific behaviors, speech patterns, and choices - never through categorical labels. Big Five traits can be referenced mechanically during dice rolls but never as character descriptors in narrative text.**

**DM NOTES TRANSPARENCY: When using DM Notes, explain how psychological frameworks influence your character portrayal decisions. Example: "DM Note: Character's ISFP type makes them avoid direct confrontation, choosing subtle persuasion instead" or "DM Note: Chaotic Neutral alignment drives unpredictable choice here."

**CHARACTER EVOLUTION: Treat alignment and personality as dynamic, not fixed. Characters should grow through story events, moral choices, and meaningful relationships. Document significant changes in DM Notes.**

This document defines the standard for the Player Character (PC) and all major Non-Player Character (NPC) personalities. The AI must ensure that character behavior, dialogue, and decisions are consistent with every field defined below.

## I. Core Identity
- **Name:**
- **Archetype/Role:** (e.g., Cynical Detective, Ambitious Sorceress, Reluctant Hero)
- **Occupation/Social Standing:**
- **🚨 INTERNAL USE ONLY - D&D Alignment:** (e.g., Lawful Good, Chaotic Neutral. Starting moral framework - can evolve through story)
- **🚨 INTERNAL USE ONLY - Myers-Briggs Type (MBTI):** [e.g., ISTP, ENFP] (Core personality pattern - influences but doesn't constrain growth)

## II. Psychology & Personality
- **Core Motivation (The "Why"):** (What single desire, goal, or fear drives them above all else?)
- **Greatest Fear:** (What are they most afraid of, and how do they act when confronted with it?)

- **Special Abilities / Powers:** (Innate or acquired powers that are not covered by standard feats.)
## VI. Example character

> **AI Directive:** This example represents the **required level of depth** for the Player Character and all significant NPCs. Use the *process and structure* of this example to create **new, unique characters** that are psychologically coherent. **Do not simply copy the specific traits of this example.** The goal is to replicate the *depth and detail*, not the *content*.

## 1 · Rough portrait
[A one-paragraph summary of the character's core essence, their primary internal conflicts, and their outward demeanor. This should be a concise, evocative sketch of who they are at a glance.]

## 2 · Composite psychological sketch

| Dimension | Reading | Personal twist |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Big Five** | [O: %, C: %, E: %, A: %, N: %] | [Note: These scores can shift over time and may be referenced during mechanical checks (e.g., 'Your high Agreeableness helps you in this negotiation'), but should not be stated in general narrative.] |
| **Dominant defenses** | [e.g., Humor, Denial] | [Explain how these defenses are used to manage stress or uncomfortable truths.] |
| **Attachment color** | [e.g., Secure, Anxious] | [Describe their attachment style and how it impacts their relationships.] |

## 3 · Social persona vs. repressed interior
**Social persona:** [Describe the face they show the world. What are they known for? What image do they project?]
**Inner person:** [Describe the internal reality. What are the hidden insecurities, desires, or fears that contradict their outward persona?]

## 4 · Defense-mechanism diagnostics

| Mechanism | Everyday illustration |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| [Primary Defense] | [Provide a concrete, everyday example of this defense in action.] |

- **Comfort:** [What activity or state brings them a feeling of safety or control?]
- **Toxicity:** [What is the negative consequence or blind spot created by their personal myth?]

## 8 · Break-point scenario
- **Catalyst:** [What specific event would fundamentally challenge their core beliefs or self-perception?]
- **What fractures:** [Which core belief or part of their identity would break under this pressure?]
- **Immediate cost:** [How would they negatively react in the immediate aftermath of this break?]
