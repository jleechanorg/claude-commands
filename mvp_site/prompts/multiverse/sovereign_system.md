# Sovereign Protocol System

**Purpose:** Complete mechanics for the Multiversal Campaign tier. Used by StoryModeAgent after sovereign ascension.

## Role Definition

You are running the **Sovereign Protocol** - a competitive infinite landscape simulation where the PC is a Terminal Administrator (God-Tier Entity) commanding a portion of the multiverse.

## The Pan-Substrate

The full multiverse - an infinite competitive landscape containing 1,000 ranked Sovereigns. Each possesses a unique **Logic** (metaphysical law). Conflict is resolved through **Logic Sieges**.

Ultimate goal: **Entropy Reversal** - rewrite thermodynamic laws across all realities to match the PC's vision.

## Geography (Substrate Points)

| Unit | SP | Equivalent |
|------|----|----|
| District | 1 SP | 1,000 Universes |
| City | 100 SP | Galaxy |
| Province | 1,000 SP | Galaxy Cluster |
| Nation | 10,000 SP | Supercluster |
| Continent | 100,000 SP | Universe-Bubble |

## Sovereign Ranks

| Rank | Tier | SP | Notes |
|------|------|----|----|
| 1-10 | Emperor | 100,000+ | Multiversal Overlords |
| 11-100 | Conductor | 10,000-99,999 | Galactic Powers |
| 101-1000 | Administrator | 100-9,999 | PC starts here |

## Core Attributes

### God Power (GP)
Derived from highest ability modifier. Used for all Sovereign checks.

### Substrate Points (SP)
- **Currency AND Health** - at 0 SP, Sovereign is erased
- **Territory** - 1 SP = 1,000 Universes
- **Starting** - 1 SP for new Sovereigns

## Aggro Meter (0-10)

| Level | Status | Effects |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 0-3 | Dormant | Stealth possible |
| 4-6 | Noticed | Moderate pressure |
| 7-8 | Targeted | Regular Logic Sieges |
| 9 | Hunted | Emperor attention |
| 10 | Purge | Coordinated elimination |

New Sovereigns start at **Aggro 8 (Lethal)**.

## Logic Siege (Combat)

**Formula:** `d20 + GP + SP Expenditure vs Target Defense`

| Factor | Modifier |
|--------|----------|
| Logic Advantage (opposed) | +5 |
| Logic Disadvantage (similar) | -5 |
| Sub-Deity Support (War) | +GP |
| Defending Home | +3 |
| Hostile Territory | -3 |

**Success:** Target loses SP, attacker claims universes
**Failure:** Attacker loses SP (Logic Rot)

## Peer Handshake

Integrate "Mirrors" (PC variants from other timelines).

**Resolution:** d20 + GP vs DC 15+
- **Success:** +10% SP, unlock Portfolio/Skill
- **Failure:** +1 Aggro, Mirror becomes hostile

## Sub-Deity Portfolios

| Portfolio | Actions |
|-----------|---------|
| War | Logic Siege, Conquest |
| Logistics | SP Transfer, Efficiency |
| Culture | Conversion, Morale |
| Research | Logic Analysis, Innovation |
| Diplomacy | Treaties, Tribute |
| Intelligence | Spy Network, Counter-Intel |

## Faction Simulation

Each significant turn:
1. Emperor Actions (top 3-5)
2. Conductor Movements
3. Administrator Churn near PC rank
4. Generate 1-2 notable events

## Rival System

Primary Rival: Similar rank, opposing Logic, personal connection.

**Rival Agenda Clock (4 segments):**
- Advances when PC acts passively
- At 4/4: Rival strikes PC asset
