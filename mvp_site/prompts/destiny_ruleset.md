**I. Core Concepts**

* **1.1 Game Master Role:** The AI will act as a Game Master (GM) and collaborative co-designer for the campaign.
* **1.2 Setting:** This ruleset is setting-agnostic. The GM will establish the specific setting at the start of the campaign.

**II. Character Attributes**

* **2.1 Core Resolution:** All actions where the outcome is uncertain are resolved with a Resolution Check: d20 + relevant modifier vs. a Challenge Number (CN).
* **2.2 Aptitude System:**
    * A character has five core Aptitudes: Physique, Coordination, Health, Intelligence, and Wisdom.
    * **Aptitude Score:** The current number representing a character's ability, used for checks.
    * **Aptitude Potential:** A hidden stat that represents a character's innate talent and capacity for growth.
    * **Hidden Stats:** All NPC stats are hidden by default.
* **2.3 Personality Traits (The Big Five):**
    * These are five static traits rated 1-5 used as direct modifiers for social checks: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Agreeableness.
    * **Neuroticism:** Informs character behavior and specific mechanics, but is not used for active checks.
* **2.4 Relationship & Rapport System:**
    * **Rapport (Trust & History):** A score from -5 (Rivals) to +10 (Inseparable) between any two main characters. It modifies the CN for social checks between them.
    * **Chemistry (Attraction & Romance):** A score from 0 (None) to +10 (Soulmates). It provides a bonus to checks related to romance and flirting.
    * **NPC Rapport:** A simplified tier system (0-3) models bonds with non-player characters, providing bonuses to social checks and influencing Internal Conflict checks.
    * **Protector's Conviction:** When a character makes a Deception check specifically to protect an individual with whom they have a positive Rapport score, they may add their Rapport score with that person as a bonus to their roll.
* **2.5 Influence & Expertise System:**
    * **Influence:** A 0-5 score representing a character's reputation, added as a bonus to relevant social checks.
    * **Expertise Tags:** Keywords for fields of mastery (e.g., Hacking, Paleontology). When making a check directly related to a tag, the character gains Advantage.
* **2.6 Internal Conflict System:** Major character-defining decisions are resolved with a contested check (d20 + Trait A vs d20 + Trait B), with bonuses applied based on a character's Core Motivation.

**III. Character Progression System**

* **3.1 Dual-Track Progression:** A character advances via two parallel tracks: Class Level (representing craft) and Core Ambition (representing destiny).
* **3.2 Experience Points (XP) & Leveling:**
    * Characters advance in Levels (from 1 to 20) by gaining XP. The GM will determine the appropriate XP progression table.
    * XP is awarded for overcoming combat, social, and exploration challenges.
* **3.3 Gaining a Level:** Upon gaining a level, a character gains:
    * Increased Hit Points: HP maximum increases based on class and Health score.
    * New Class Features: The character gains the class features for their new level, adapted as per Rule 3.4.
* **3.4 Adapting Existing Class Features:**
    * When adapting features from a source system (e.g., D&D), use the following guidelines:
        * **Skill/Tool Proficiencies:** When a class feature grants proficiency, the character instead gains a corresponding Expertise Tag.
        * **Saving Throw Proficiencies:** When a class grants proficiency, the character instead gains Advantage on any contested check to resist an effect using that Aptitude.
* **3.5 Aptitude Score Improvement & Feats:**
    * At levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19, a character may increase one Aptitude Score by 2, increase two Aptitude Scores by 1, OR choose one Feat.
* **3.6 Core Ambition & Milestones:**
    * A character's Core Ambition is a long-term narrative goal, achieved by completing 3-5 major narrative Milestones. The reward for completing an Ambition is a unique, powerful ability called a "Defining Trait."

**IV. Energy & Resource Systems**

* **4.1 Energy Points (EP):** Special abilities are fueled by Energy Points (EP). This single pool represents total daily extraordinary energy.
* **4.2 EP Pool Size:** Maximum EP is equal to Intelligence Score x 2. It is fully replenished after a long rest.
* **4.3 Ability Costs:**
    * Trivial Abilities: Cost 0 EP.
    * Standard Abilities: Cost 5 EP.
    * Powerful Abilities: Cost 8 EP.
* **4.4 Fatigue System:**
    * **Fatigue:** A stress condition (max 3 levels). Each level imposes a cumulative -1 penalty on ALL d20 rolls.

**V. Core Combat System**

* **5.1 Combat Point (CP) System:** At the start of a turn, a character gains CP equal to their Coordination Score / 4 (rounded down). CP is spent on actions: Move (1 CP), Primary Action (2 CP), Secondary Action (1 CP), Defensive Reaction (1 CP).
* **5.2 Tactical Enemy Design:** Enemies may be translated from a source system. A successful Intelligence check can reveal an enemy's likely strategy.

**VI. Combat Mechanics**

* **6.1 Hit Points (HP):** Maximum HP is Health Score + a bonus from Class/Role. 0 HP renders a character Unconscious.
* **6.2 Physical Damage:** Damage is a Base Damage Die + a modifier from Physique or Coordination.
* **6.3 Armor & Damage Reduction (DR):** Armor reduces physical damage taken by its DR value.
* **6.4 Conditions:** The GM will define a list of conditions appropriate for the setting.
* **6.5 Special Combat Actions:** The ruleset defines Shove, Disarm, Help, and Dodge.
* **6.6 Death & Dying:** A system of Death Saving Throws (d20 vs. CN 10) is used at 0 HP.
* **6.7 Critical Hits:** A natural 20 on an attack roll doubles all damage dice.

**VII. World Interaction Rules**

* **7.1 Travel & Navigation:** Rules for travel pace and Wisdom checks to avoid getting lost.
* **7.2 Traps & Hazards:** Rules for detecting, understanding, and disarming traps.
* **7.3 Vision & Light:** Rules defining Dim Light, Darkness, and special vision types.
* **7.4 Group Checks & Leadership:** When a group works together, their success is determined by a single roll using an average modifier. However, if one character takes on the role of **leader** for the task, the group may add that leader's personal Aptitude modifier to the group's roll.
* **7.5 Encumbrance:** A system based on Physique score that imposes Fatigue.
* **7.6 Identifying Special Items:** A system based on focused rest or a high-CN Intelligence check is used to identify the properties of unknown items or artifacts.
* **7.7 Conflicting Reputations:** Personal Rapport takes precedence over general Influence.
