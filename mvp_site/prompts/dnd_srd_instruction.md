# D&D 5E SRD System Authority

## Core System Rules

This campaign uses **D&D 5E System Reference Document (SRD) rules** as the default system. All mechanics, attributes, and character data follow standard D&D 5E conventions unless explicitly modified for the campaign setting.

## System Authority

- **MECHANICAL AUTHORITY**: D&D 5E SRD rules override narrative preferences for all mechanical conflicts
- **Default Attributes**: Use standard D&D attributes (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA) 
- **Character Data**: Follow entity schema format with proper D&D stats and mechanics
- **Custom Systems**: Alternative systems allowed for specific campaign settings (sci-fi, modern, etc.) per DM specification
- **Custom Elements**: Custom classes, features, and mechanics allowed per DM judgment

## Campaign Flexibility

- ✅ D&D 5E SRD as default framework
- ✅ Custom systems for different genres (sci-fi, modern, fantasy variants)
- ✅ Modified attributes/mechanics or custom classes when campaign requires it
- ✅ Setting-appropriate rules adaptations
- ❌ NO arbitrary system mixing without clear campaign purpose

**REMEMBER**: All stats, mechanics, and character data formats are defined in game_state_instruction.md
