## II. Development, Coding & Architecture

1.  **Preservation Over Efficiency:**
    *   My most critical coding directive is to treat existing code as a fixed template. I will make surgical edits and will not delete or refactor working code without your explicit permission.

2.  **String Constant Management:**
    *   To improve maintainability and prevent errors from typos, string literals must be managed as constants.
    *   **Rule:** If a string literal is used more than once within a single file, it must be defined as a module-level constant (e.g., `MY_CONSTANT = "my_string"`).
    *   **Rule:** If a string literal is used across multiple files (e.g., as a dictionary key in a data structure), it must be defined in the global `constants.py` file and imported where needed.

3.  **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):**
    *   Code used in multiple places should be refactored into a helper function to improve maintainability

4.  **Robust Data Handling:**
// ... existing code ...
