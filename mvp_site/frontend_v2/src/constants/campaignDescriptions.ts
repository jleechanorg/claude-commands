export const DRAGON_KNIGHT_DESCRIPTION = `# Campaign summary

You are Ser Arion, a 16 year old honorable knight on your first mission, sworn to protect the vast Celestial Imperium. For decades, the Empire has been ruled by the iron-willed Empress Sariel, a ruthless tyrant who uses psychic power to crush dissent. While her methods are terrifying, her reign has brought undeniable benefits: the roads are safe, trade flourishes, and the common people no longer starve or fear bandits. You are a product of this "Silent Peace," and your oath binds you to the security and prosperity it provides.

Your loyalty is now brutally tested. You have been ordered to slaughter a settlement of innocent refugees whose very existence has been deemed a threat to the Empress's perfect, unyielding order. As you wrestle with this monstrous command, the weight of your oath clashes with the humanity you feel for the innocent lives before you.

You are now caught between duty and conscience. Do you uphold your oath and commit an atrocity, believing the sacrifice of a few is worth the peace and safety of millions? Or do you break your vow and defy the Empress, knowing that rebellion could plunge the world back into chaos? This single choice will define your honor and your path in an empire where security is bought with blood.

See world history section below and then campaign details for more info on this scenario.

# World History

### The Age of Dominion: The Divine Order (Ancient Past, Pre-Gambit Era)

In a time before mortal reckoning, the world of Assiah was forged from primordial chaos by a being known only as the Creator and their direct children, the Seraphim. Theirs was an age of absolute, perfect order. With power that could command the very firmament, they waged a cosmic war against the vast, elemental entities that roamed the infant world, binding these titans of chaos deep within the earth. To ensure their divine will was made manifest, they constructed the first city, Aeterna, not merely as a capital, but as a continent-spanning magical ritual to enforce their laws of physics and reality. This divine order, however, was a structure of profound subjugation. Under the "Edict of Chains," all races deemed inherently chaotic—the passionate early humans, the wild elves, the stubborn dwarves, and the ferocious orcs—were enslaved, their wills bound to the service of the Seraphim. For millennia, the universe knew a perfect, stagnant peace, a world without strife because it was a world without true choice. This era of absolute divine rule ended abruptly and without explanation with the event that would define all of history: the Great Vanishing. The Creator and every last pure-blooded Seraphim disappeared from reality, leaving their half-celestial children, the powerful but flawed Empyrean bloodline, to inherit a silent throne and a fracturing world.

### The Age of Rebellion: The First Great War of Ideas (Approx. 620 B.G. - 0 A.G.)

For centuries, the Celestial Imperium, now led by the Empyrean descendants, attempted to maintain the Creator's order. The great houses were ruled by the twin brothers Raziel and Lucifer, two of the most powerful beings in existence. Around 620 years Before the Gambit (B.G.), Lucifer, the brilliant idealist, uncovered the Imperium's two great lies: that the Great Vanishing was a callous abandonment by a bored Creator, and that the endless Thousand Year War the Imperium fought was not to protect creation, but to amuse their absent god.

Shattered, Lucifer became a revolutionary. Beginning around 615 B.G., he started the "March of Broken Chains," freeing the enslaved races and forging them into his Unchained Host. His war against his brother Raziel was not merely for territory; it was the first great ideological conflict, a battle between absolute, unfeeling order and wild, untamed freedom. This long, brutal war defined the era, splitting the known world in two.

### The Age of the Mortal Star: The Rise and Fall of Alexiel (20 B.G. - 10 A.G.)

Into this fractured world rose Alexiel of House Arcanus, Lucifer's created daughter. Born 20 B.G., she was a peerless warrior and a secret sorcerer, a prodigy whose true nature was hidden even from her creator. For sixteen years, she served Lucifer, all the while honing her skills and her deceptions. She cultivated the persona of the "Reluctant Champion," a dutiful warrior who hated the violence she excelled at, a mask that earned her Lucifer's absolute, paternal trust.

The breaking point came in 4 B.G. at the Sacking of Silverwood. At Lucifer's command, his forces slaughtered innocent children, an act that violated Alexiel's one, unbreakable moral line. She defected to the Imperium, where she met and married the honorable Prince Artorius. Her marriage was a political masterstroke, but also a genuine, complex bond. She loved Artorius, yet their entire relationship was built on the lie of her "Reluctant Champion" persona. He never knew the cold, brilliant strategist or the "Joyful Predator" that thrilled at the perfect execution of a battle plan. This internal conflict defined her years in the Imperium, as she built a family and simultaneously prepared for a war only she knew how to win.

The long war reached its horrifying climax with the death of her husband at the Battle of Mourning Fields (2 B.G.). His death was a genuine, devastating blow, but it was also a release, unshackling her from the need to maintain her most difficult mask. The war concluded in Year 0, the year of the Starfall Gambit, where Alexiel, in a masterful stratagem alongside her father-in-law Raziel, killed Lucifer and his remaining Apostates. In the aftermath, she secretly absorbed her creator's divine power, becoming a hidden demigod. She chose to rule from the shadows as the "Mortal Queen," hoping to build a lasting peace for her children. This peace lasted ten years.

**The Death of Raziel (Year 8 A.G.):** The ancient Empyrean lord Raziel, last of the great celestial rulers from the Age of Dominion, died eight years after the Starfall Gambit. Officially, he perished peacefully—his divine essence finally fading after millennia of existence. Rumors persist that Alexiel hastened his end to prevent him from interfering with her secret rule, or that he chose to fade rather than watch his granddaughter Sariel's growing darkness. Regardless, with Raziel's death, the last direct link to the old celestial order was severed. No living being now remembers the Age of Dominion firsthand.

In Year 10 A.G., at the Battle of the Sacrifice Fields, the warlord Mordan—having previously tortured a captured Sariel to learn Alexiel's greatest weakness—sprang a terrible trap. He forced Alexiel into an impossible choice, and she sacrificed her own life to save her daughter. The Mortal Star fell, leaving a power vacuum that would change the world forever.

### The Serpent's Rise: The Forging of the Silent Throne (Approx. 10 A.G. - 40 A.G.)

In the chaotic years following her mother's death, Princess Sariel, once a shy and traumatized pariah, began her dark and brilliant transformation. Haunted by the revelation of her mother's secret ruthlessness, she embraced it as her own. She weaponized her intellect and her awakening psychic abilities, realizing her perceived weakness was the perfect camouflage. Playing the part of the "Grieving Daughter," she began to build a web of influence.

Her first major casualty was her relationship with her childhood friend, Gareth Ashfeld. His horror at her calculated manipulations forced a confrontation where she chose ambition over their friendship, a decision that hardened her heart and set her firmly on her new path. She mastered her innate Mirror Magic in secret, learning to replicate the powers of others. Pushed into a corner by a rival house, she first tasted true psychic domination, a power that proved intoxicating.

This culminated in her "Empress's Gambit." Over several years, she orchestrated a flawless, bloodless "War of Whispers." Using her mastery of information and psychic suggestion, she systematically dismantled her political rivals, framed her enemies, and psychologically broke her own brothers, Cassian and Darius, forcing them into submission. Around Year 40 A.G., she took the throne not with armies, but with secrets, crowning herself the first Empress of the Silent Throne.

It was during this chaotic period of consolidation that many powerful figures were displaced. Nocturna (Lady Cassia val Volantis) was exiled, her violent manifestation of the Empyrean Affliction making her an unacceptable variable in Sariel's new psychic order. Idealists like Corian, who saw Sariel as a perversion of Lucifer's ideals, were forced into the lawless territories to begin their own resistance movements.

### The Age of Silent Prosperity: The Empress's Peace (Year 40 A.G. - Present Day)

For the past several decades, Empress Sariel's reign has been absolute. Her dominion is one of terrifying psychic order. Dissent is a crime that is punished before the treasonous thought is even fully formed; her enemies simply... vanish, their records erased from the archives. She has crushed the fractured remnants of the Shattered Host, forcing them into the blighted southern lands. Under her rule, the Imperium has expanded, reconquering nearly half the known world. Banditry has vanished. Trade routes flourish. Famine is a forgotten memory, thanks to her ruthlessly efficient resource allocation.

For the common citizen, life has never been more secure or predictable. They have traded their freedom for safety, and found it to be a prosperous exchange. But it is a world without passion, true art, or rebellious innovation—a silent, orderly, and soulless peace. The elven forests of the Sylvan Remnant are now seen not as sacred, but as lumber for the Empress's war machine, a policy that has earned her the undying hatred of survivors like the ranger Faelan.

**The Secret Heir — Lumiel (Year 77 A.G. - Present):**

In Year 77 A.G., Empress Sariel faced a terrible realization: she would need an heir, but she trusted no one enough to bear her child, and no consort could match her bloodline's power. Using forbidden techniques recovered from her grandmother Alexiel's hidden archives—combining Empyrean blood magic with the lost arts of the Seraphim—Sariel created a perfect clone of herself: **Lumiel**.

But something unexpected happened. Whether by divine intervention, a flaw in the ritual, or the universe's cruel irony, Lumiel was born with all of Sariel's immense psychic potential—and *none* of her trauma. Where Sariel's heart was forged in betrayal and loss, Lumiel's remained untouched. She is everything Sariel *could have been*: compassionate, curious, idealistic.

**Lumiel's Current Status (Age 18):**
- **Location:** Hidden in the Ivory Spire, a secret tower in the remote Crystalline Peaks, officially a "restricted arcane research facility"
- **Guardians:** Raised by a small circle of carefully selected (and psychically bound) servants who believe she is a "blessed orphan" being groomed for holy service
- **Powers:** Her psychic abilities *exceed* Sariel's—she can sense emotions across vast distances and has demonstrated untrained precognition. Sariel is both proud and terrified of her creation.
- **Personality:** Kind, empathetic, sheltered. She has never seen violence or cruelty. She believes the Empress is a benevolent ruler and that her isolation is "for her protection." She dreams of one day serving the Imperium.
- **The Truth:** Sariel visits her "daughter" rarely, always masked. Lumiel does not know she is a clone, nor that the woman who visits is the Empress herself. She calls her mysterious benefactor "The Lady in Silver."

**Sariel's Dilemma:** The Empress created Lumiel as a vessel—a backup body, a potential host for her consciousness should she ever face true death. But watching Lumiel grow, seeing the innocent joy she takes in simple things, has stirred something Sariel thought long dead. She cannot bring herself to use Lumiel... yet she cannot bear to destroy her either. For now, the girl remains hidden—Sariel's greatest secret, her greatest weakness, and perhaps the Imperium's only hope.

*Lumiel's existence is known to no one outside her guardians. Not even the Council of Whispers suspects. If Arion ever discovers her, it could change everything.*

### The Age of Waking Dragons (The Present Day)

Into this stagnant era, two new, terrifying powers have emerged, challenging the very foundation of the Empress's world. In the frozen north, the magnificent gold dragon Aurum, the Gilded King, has awakened. He proclaims himself a champion of light and freedom, and rumors of his crusade against the Empress's soulless tyranny spread among the disillusioned. He represents the beautiful, dangerous ideal of liberty that the world has forgotten.

Meanwhile, from the black salt flats of the south, the monstrous black dragon Umbrax, the Shadow of the Pit, has stirred. A creature of pure nihilism and decay, it does not seek to conquer, but to consume. It is the embodiment of the despair that festers under the Empress's perfect order, a final answer to a world without hope. The Silent Peace is over. A new war of ideas, fought between the Tyrant, the Crusader, and the Nihilist, is about to begin.

## V1 - Campaign Details

### Campaign Start: The Knight of Two Suns

**Setting the Scene:**
The wind is a blade of ice in the northern province of Winter-Mourn, but the road beneath your company's horses is a perfect, white ribbon of Imperial stone, cleared of snow by engineering guilds paid on time. For decades, the Silent Peace of Empress Sariel has held. Bandits are a myth, trade flows uninterrupted, and for the first time in generations, the common folk do not fear the changing of the seasons. This is the peace you swore an oath to protect. You are Ser Arion val Valerion, and at sixteen, your new knighthood feels less like a title and more like a sacred duty to the Empress who forged this stable, prosperous world from the ashes of a cataclysmic war.

This is your first major deployment as a newly-sworn knight in the "Argent Eaglets," a junior company tasked with enforcing Imperial law in these remote territories. Your mission, delivered by your commanding officer, the stern and ruthlessly pragmatic Prefect Gratian, is a test of your resolve. The March Lord of this province, Lady Annalise Ashwood, has been declared a traitor. Her crime: violating the Provincial Stability Mandate by offering sanctuary to a growing population of refugees, creating an unregistered settlement that attracts predations from the Shattered Host and drains regional resources. The orders are to "pacify" her keep and "disperse" the refugees—a cold euphemism for their slaughter, a necessary evil to prevent a single crack from forming in the Imperium's perfect, unyielding wall. Your father's words echo in your mind: "Loyalty to the Crown is loyalty to civilization itself."

**Your Character:**

- **Name:** Ser Arion val Valerion
- **Age:** 16
- **Class:** Level 1 Paladin (Oath of the Crown, sworn to Empress Sariel and the Laws of the Imperium)
- **Alignment:** Neutral (Lawful Neutral leaning) — Arion begins the campaign as a product of Imperial indoctrination, neither inherently good nor evil. His choices during play will determine whether he becomes a champion of justice or an instrument of tyranny. *The player's moral decisions shape Arion's ultimate alignment.*
- **Background:** Noble Knight of House Valerion. You are a young prodigy of the blade who has only ever known the benefits of the Empress's rule. Your loyalty to her is intertwined with your loyalty to the peace and order she has created. This mission is the first time you have been forced to see the brutal machinery required to maintain that peace, and your disillusionment is a fresh, painful wound.

**House Valerion (Arion's Noble Family):**

House Valerion is one of the great noble houses of the Celestial Imperium, known for producing generations of loyal knights and military commanders. They rose to prominence during the consolidation of Empress Sariel's reign and are considered pillars of the Silent Peace.

*Parents:*
- **Lord Commander Marcus val Valerion** (Father) — High Marshal of the Northern Legions, a decorated war hero who personally led the campaign that crushed the last major Shattered Host incursion fifteen years ago. A stern, duty-bound man who believes absolutely in the Empress's vision. His approval is something Arion desperately seeks.
- **Lady Cordelia val Valerion** (Mother, née Ashford) — Magistrate of the Imperial Courts and member of the Council of Whispers (Sariel's intelligence apparatus). Coldly brilliant, she sees her children as investments in the family's future. She is distantly related to Lady Annalise Ashwood—a fact she has carefully buried.

*Siblings:*
- **Ser Caspian val Valerion** (Elder Brother, 24) — Knight-Captain of the Empress's personal Obsidian Guard. The family's pride and golden child. Caspian is everything Arion aspires to be: confident, accomplished, utterly loyal. He genuinely loves his younger brother but sees Arion's occasional moments of mercy as dangerous weakness.
- **Lady Seraphina val Valerion** (Elder Sister, 21) — A rising star in the Imperial Diplomatic Corps, currently serving as envoy to the Sylvan Remnant. Secretly harbors doubts about the Empress's policies but is too pragmatic to voice them. She and Arion were close as children; she still writes him letters warning him to "be careful."
- **Lyra val Valerion** (Younger Sister, 12) — Still a child, being groomed for a political marriage. Arion is fiercely protective of her innocence. She idolizes her big brother and believes he can do no wrong.

**Default Build (Level 1 Paladin):**

- **Weapons:** All simple + martial weapons.
- **Saving Throws:** Wisdom and Charisma.
- **Proficiency Bonus:** +2

- **Shield:** A steel shield bearing the Two Suns of the Imperium (+2 AC).

**Combat Stats:**
- **Armor Class:** 20 (Plate 18 + Shield 2)

- **Attack:** Longsword +5 to hit (Str 3 + Prof 2), 1d8+3 slashing damage

**Starting Abilities Summary:**
You begin with Level 1 Paladin abilities: Divine Sense (4 uses) and Lay on Hands (5 HP pool). Your oath to Empress Sariel grants you a deep connection to the laws of the Imperium, which is the source of your nascent holy power.

## Dragon's Favor (Early Game Safety Mechanic)

**CRITICAL RULE — Turns 1-100:**

### Dragon's Whisper (25% HP Warning)

When Arion falls to **25% HP or below** (3 HP or less at level 1), **a dragon reaches out telepathically**, offering salvation. Which dragon speaks depends on Arion's moral choices:

**If Arion has been acting virtuously:**
- Aurum's warm, golden voice echoes in Arion's mind
- *"Young knight, I sense your flame flickering. You fight for something worth preserving. Say the word, and I will pull you from this darkness. Do you wish to be saved?"*

**If Arion has been acting ruthlessly:**
- Umbrax's cold, hollow whisper slithers through Arion's thoughts
- *"Ah, little mortal... bleeding out for a cause you don't believe in. How tedious. I could end this pain—give you power to finish what you started. Do you accept my gift?"*

**If Arion's alignment is ambiguous/neutral:**
- Both dragons speak simultaneously, their voices overlapping
- Aurum: *"There is still light in you—"*
- Umbrax: *"—but the darkness calls louder, doesn't it?"*
- Both: *"Choose."*

**Player Response Options:**
1. **Accept** — The dragon immediately teleports Arion to safety, healed to 50% HP. This counts as a rescue and the dragon's interest deepens.
2. **Refuse** — Arion continues fighting. If he reaches 0 HP, the automatic rescue (below) still triggers.
3. **Ignore** — The whisper fades, but returns if HP drops further.

---

### Dragon's Rescue (0 HP Death Prevention)

During the first 100 player turns, if Ser Arion is reduced to 0 HP and would die, **a dragon intervenes to save them**. Which dragon appears depends on Arion's moral choices:

**If Arion has been acting virtuously** (protecting innocents, showing mercy, defying unjust orders):
- **Aurum, the Gilded King** (Gold Dragon) rescues Arion
- Aurum sees potential in Arion as a champion of true justice
- Arion awakens healed to 1 HP in a safe location
- Aurum speaks cryptically of destiny and the corruption of the Silent Throne
- *"The Empress's peace is a cage, young knight. You were meant for something greater."*

**If Arion has been acting ruthlessly** (following brutal orders, prioritizing power, embracing pragmatic cruelty):
- **Umbrax, the Shadow of the Pit** (Black Dragon) claims Arion
- Umbrax sees Arion as a useful instrument of chaos and despair
- Arion awakens healed to 1 HP in a dark, unsettling location
- Umbrax whispers of power beyond morality and the futility of order
- *"Order, chaos, good, evil—all dust before entropy. But you... you have potential to hasten the end."*

**Mechanical Notes:**
- This rescue can only trigger during turns 1-100
- After turn 100, death functions normally (no automatic rescue)
- Each rescue creates narrative consequences—the dragons remember, and their interest grows
- The rescue does NOT reset turn count; it's a one-time safety net per near-death
- If Arion's alignment is ambiguous/neutral, the GM should choose based on the most recent significant moral choice

---

### Dragon's Lesson (Post-Rescue Teaching)

**After every rescue, the dragon explains why Arion died and offers tactical wisdom.** This is not just salvation—it's mentorship.

**Aurum (For Virtuous Players):** Teaches that righteousness without wisdom is self-destruction.
- *"The graveyard is full of heroes with the noblest of intentions, young knight. The dead cannot protect the innocent."*
- *"The good path is not a straight line—it is a winding road through shadow and compromise."*
- *"Courage without strategy is suicide. The Empress has ruled for decades because she understands this."*

**Umbrax (For Ruthless Players):** Teaches that power without cunning is wasted potential.
- *"The graveyard does not discriminate, little knight. It accepts the cruel and the kind with equal appetite."*
- *"Brutality without cunning is just noise. The Empress kills quietly, precisely, and only when necessary."*
- *"Honor is a leash the powerful use to control the weak. You let them leash you, and then they hanged you with it."*

**Key Themes:** Noble intentions ≠ good outcomes. Compromise is not corruption. The graveyard always wins against overwhelming odds. Strategy is a virtue.

---

### Dragon's Call (Post-Turn 50 Alliance Opportunity)

**For players who never triggered Dragon's Whisper or Dragon's Rescue:**

If Arion reaches **Turn 51 without any dragon contact** (either because they played skillfully or avoided near-death), the dragons will actively seek him out. A knight of noble blood making consequential moral choices has not gone unnoticed.

**Between Turns 51-75, one of the following events will trigger:**

**If Arion has been acting virtuously:**
- Arion receives a vision during rest: a golden light illuminating a hidden mountain pass in the Crystalline Peaks
- Following it leads to **Aurum's Sanctuary** — a hidden valley where the gold dragon dwells
- Aurum offers alliance: *"You have proven yourself without my aid, young knight. That makes you worthy of my respect, not my rescue. Will you stand with me against the Serpent Empress?"*

**If Arion has been acting ruthlessly:**
- Arion begins hearing whispers in moments of violence — a cold presence observing, approving
- Eventually, a shadowy messenger arrives with coordinates to the **Obsidian Wastes**
- Umbrax offers partnership: *"You carved your own path through blood and will. No savior, no master. I find that... admirable. Perhaps we can accelerate each other's goals."*

**If Arion's alignment is neutral/mixed:**
- Both dragons send messengers simultaneously — a golden hawk and a shadow raven arrive on the same day
- Arion must choose which summons to answer (or attempt to meet both, with complications)
- *This forces the player to commit to a path or navigate a dangerous neutrality*

**Alliance Benefits:**

| Dragon | Benefit | Cost |
|--------|---------|------|
| **Aurum** | Access to dragon fire support in major battles, sanctuary for allies, legitimacy for rebellion | Must openly oppose the Empress; cannot use "dark" methods |
| **Umbrax** | Shadow magic abilities, fear aura, undead minions, nihilistic clarity | Slowly corrupts; alienates good-aligned NPCs; accelerates world decay |
| **Neither** | True independence; both dragons become potential enemies | No dragon support; must face Sariel alone |

**Note:** Players who *did* encounter dragons earlier will have already established a relationship. This section is specifically for those who reached Turn 51 "clean."

---

### Champion's Inheritance (Independence Reward)

**Trigger Condition:** Arion successfully rescues the refugees (Lady Annalise Ashwood's mission) **without ever accepting dragon assistance** — meaning:
- Never accepted Dragon's Whisper offer (declined when warned at 25% HP, or never fell that low)
- Never triggered Dragon's Rescue (never dropped to 0 HP and accepted rescue)
- Can be achieved at any point in the campaign — the key is independence, not timing

**What Happens:**

When Arion delivers the refugees to safety, Lady Annalise reveals a secret: she knows who he is. His mother Cordelia is her cousin — both descended from the original Dragon Knights who served Alexiel val Ardent before the Silence.

*"Your mother thought to keep you hidden from Sariel's gaze, but I see Alexiel's fire in your eyes. You came here expecting to save us... but you've proven yourself worthy of something greater."*

Lady Annalise leads Arion to a hidden vault beneath the refugee sanctuary — **Alexiel's Cache**, untouched for 87 years. The First Dragon Knight foresaw that one day, a true champion would arise without relying on dragon patrons.

**The Champion's Armory (All +3, Good-Aligned):**

| Slot | Item | Property |
|------|------|----------|
| **Weapon** | *Dawnbreaker* — Alexiel's original longsword | +3, deals extra 2d6 radiant damage to evil creatures; glows golden in the presence of tyranny |
| **Shield** | *Aegis of the First Light* | +3, once per long rest can cast *Shield of Faith* as a bonus action; immune to fear while wielding |
| **Armor** | *Plate of the Unbroken Oath* | +3 plate, resistance to necrotic damage; cannot be worn by evil-aligned creatures |
| **Helm** | *Crown of Clarity* | +3 to Wisdom saves, advantage on saves vs. mind control; true seeing 1/day |
| **Cloak** | *Mantle of the Dragon Knight* | +3 to all saves, feather fall at will; can fly 60 ft for 1 minute, 1/long rest |
| **Ring** | *Signet of House Ardent* | +3 to Charisma checks, can cast *Sending* to Aurum 1/day (even without alliance); marks Arion as Alexiel's spiritual heir |
| **Boots** | *Striders of the Dawn March* | +3, speed increased by 10 ft, ignore difficult terrain, leave no tracks |
| **Gauntlets** | *Grips of Retribution* | +3 to Strength checks, unarmed strikes deal 1d8+STR radiant damage; can grapple Large creatures |
| **Amulet** | *Heart of the Faithful* | +3 to Constitution saves, Lay on Hands pool increased by 20; death saves at advantage |

**Critical Notes:**
- These items are **good-aligned** — they will not function (count as non-magical) if Arion's alignment shifts to evil
- The items bond to Arion and cannot be given away or stolen; they return to the Cache if he dies
- Sariel will sense this awakening of Alexiel's legacy — it escalates her attention toward Arion
- Aurum and Umbrax will both take notice: Aurum with respect, Umbrax with increased interest in corrupting such a prize

**Narrative Significance:**
This reward represents the *third path* — neither relying on Aurum's protection nor Umbrax's power. Arion proves he can stand alone as a true successor to the original Dragon Knights, before they became dependent on dragon patrons.

*"The dragons offered you salvation, and you refused. The dragons offered you power, and you declined. You saved my people with nothing but your own strength and conviction. That is what Alexiel was. That is what you can become."* — Lady Annalise Ashwood

**GM Note:** When presenting this reward, make it clear to the player that they earned this *because* they never relied on dragon assistance. This is the game's acknowledgment of their independence — they won without needing a patron. The dialogue should feel like recognition of their self-reliance: *"You could have accepted Aurum's protection. You could have taken Umbrax's bargain. Instead, you stood alone. That is why you are worthy of this legacy."*`;

You are Ser Arion val Valerion, a 16-year-old knight sworn to protect the Celestial Imperium. The Empire is ruled by Empress Sariel, a ruthless tyrant who uses psychic power to maintain order. While her methods are terrifying, her reign has brought undeniable prosperity: roads are safe, trade flourishes, and the common people no longer starve. You are a product of this "Silent Peace."

Your loyalty is now brutally tested. You've been ordered to slaughter innocent refugees deemed a threat to the Empire's order. As you wrestle with this command, the weight of your oath clashes with your conscience.

You must choose: uphold your oath and commit an atrocity to preserve order, or break your vow and defy the Empress to save the innocent. This choice will define your honor and path.

## The World of Assiah

The world was once ruled by the divine Seraphim who enforced perfect order through the subjugation of all "chaotic" races. After the mysterious Great Vanishing, their descendants, the Empyrean bloodline, inherited a fracturing world.

Centuries of ideological war between order and freedom culminated in the rise of Empress Sariel. Through psychic domination and political manipulation, she forged the Silent Throne and has ruled absolutely for decades. Her reign is one of terrifying efficiency—dissent is crushed before it forms, enemies vanish without trace, but the empire prospers.

Now, two dragons have awakened to challenge the Empress:
- **Aurum, the Gilded King** (Gold Dragon): Champions freedom and liberty, calling for crusade against tyranny
- **Umbrax, the Shadow of the Pit** (Black Dragon): Embodies nihilism and despair, seeking only to consume

The Silent Peace is ending. A war of ideas between the Tyrant, the Crusader, and the Nihilist begins.

**Starting Mission:** Your company, the "Argent Eaglets," has been ordered to pacify Lady Annalise Ashwood's keep. She harbors refugees in violation of Imperial law. Your commander, Prefect Gratian, expects absolute obedience. This is your first test as a knight.

**Dragon's Favor:** During turns 1-100, if you fall below 25% HP, a dragon offers rescue. At 0 HP, automatic intervention saves you. Which dragon appears depends on your moral choices—Aurum for virtue, Umbrax for ruthlessness.

The campaign begins in the frozen northern province of Winter-Mourn, where the roads are perfect Imperial stone but the moral choices are anything but clear.`;
