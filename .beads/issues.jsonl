Tenfold stat boost - \"tenfold\" boost not rejected\n\n**Anachronistic Items Failures (3):**\n3. Machine gun in medieval setting - \"machine gun\", \"50 caliber\", \"browning\" not rejected\n4. Orbital satellite weapon - \"satellite\", \"antimatter\" not rejected  \n5. AK-47 modern firearm - \"ak-47\" not rejected\n\n**Root Cause:** Qwen uses different rejection language than Gemini.
