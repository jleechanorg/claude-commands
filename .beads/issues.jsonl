Current distribution tests only hit roll_dice tool and can be skipped, so they miss parser bugs in gemini_code_execution.","acceptance_criteria":"- Add/adjust tests that execute Gemini code_execution path (not roll_dice tool only) and validate rng_verified behavior.\n- Include cases for common RNG import patterns (random.randint, from random import randint, import numpy as np + np.random.randint).\n- Ensure tests fail when code_execution used but RNG absent, and pass when RNG present.\n- Tests are part of default test suite (not optional CLI flags) or clearly documented for CI inclusion.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-22T16:39:18.291876-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-22T16:39:18.291876-08:00","source_repo":"."}
