CombatAgent triggers RewardsAgent at combat end rather than processing rewards itself.\n\n### Architecture Options\n\n**Option A: RewardsAgent triggers at combat end**\n```\nCombatAgent (combat_phase: active) \u2192 combat ends \u2192 RewardsAgent activates\n                                                    \u2193\n                                            Process XP, loot, level-up\n```\n\n**Option B: Shared RewardsProcessor utility**\n```\nCombatAgent \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n                  \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2192 RewardsProcessor.process_rewards()\nRewardsAgent \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n```\n\n### Trigger Mechanism\nLike CombatAgent checks `in_combat`, RewardsAgent checks for pending rewards:\n\n1. **Combat end**: `combat_phase == \"ended\"` AND `combat_summary.xp_awarded`\n2. **Encounter end**: `encounter_state.encounter_completed == true`\n3. **Milestone**: `rewards_pending` exists in game_state\n\n### Agent Selection Priority\n1. GodModeAgent (explicit override)\n2. CombatAgent (in_combat = true, combat_phase = active)\n3. **RewardsAgent** (rewards pending from combat OR encounter) \u2190 NEW\n4. StoryModeAgent (default)\n\n### State Schema\n\n```python\n# Unified rewards_pending (used by both combat and non-combat)\nrewards_pending: {\n    \"source\": \"combat\" | \"encounter\" | \"quest\" | \"milestone\",\n    \"source_id\": str,  # combat_session_id or encounter_id\n    \"xp\": int,\n    \"gold\": int,\n    \"items\": [...],\n    \"level_up_available\": bool\n}\n\n# encounter_state (new, mirrors combat_state pattern)\nencounter_state: {\n    \"encounter_active\": bool,\n    \"encounter_id\": str,\n    \"encounter_type\": \"heist\" | \"social\" | \"stealth\" | \"puzzle\" | \"quest\",\n    \"difficulty\": \"easy\" | \"medium\" | \"hard\" | \"deadly\",\n    \"participants\": [...],\n    \"encounter_completed\": bool,\n    \"encounter_summary\": {...}  # Like combat_summary\n}\n```\n\n### Prompt Focus\n- XP calculation rules (CR-to-XP for defeated, milestone XP for objectives)\n- Level-up processing and spell/feature selection\n- Loot distribution\n- State cleanup after rewards processed\n\n### Archival Pattern (Same as Combat)\nAt next action START in `_prepare_game_state()`:\n1. Check if `rewards_pending` exists\n2. Archive to `rewards_history[]`\n3. Clear `rewards_pending`\n4. Process level-up if threshold reached", "acceptance_criteria": "- Non-combat encounters automatically process XP when completed\n- Level-ups are offered when XP threshold reached  \n- Works alongside CombatAgent (combat still uses existing flow)\n- Narrative kill/defeat triggers reward processing\n- encounter_history archives completed encounters", "notes": "## Investigation: Sariel Killer Campaign\n\n### What Happened\nCombat with 3 \"Ghost\" operators:\n- Multiple attack rolls: `1d20+8 = 11, 11, 12, 23, 22, 26, 22` (hits and misses)\n- Damage rolls: `17, 15, 7` damage dealt\n- Result: \"three ghosts neutralized, zero casualties\"\n- Player continued to interrogate wounded guard\n\n### What's Missing\n- **NO `in_combat = true`** was ever set\n- **NO initiative order** tracked\n- **NO combat_summary** generated\n- **NO XP awarded** for defeating 3 elite operators\n- **NO level-up check** triggered\n\n### Root Cause\nThe LLM handled combat narratively (rolling dice, describing attacks) but never entered the formal combat system. This happens when:\n1. Combat starts as a \"surprise\" or \"ambush\" scenario\n2. The LLM treats it as an action sequence rather than formal combat\n3. There's no trigger to set `in_combat = true`\n\n### Implications for RewardsAgent\n\nRewardsAgent should detect \"narrative combat\" by looking for:\n1. **Attack roll patterns**: Multiple `1d20+X vs AC` rolls in recent turns\n2. **Damage rolls**: `XdY + Z` damage dealt\n3. **Defeat language**: \"neutralized\", \"eliminated\", \"killed\", \"defeated\"\n4. **Enemy count**: NPCs that were combatants are now dead/incapacitated\n\nThis is separate from formal combat but still deserves XP rewards.\n\n### Proposed Detection Logic\n\n```python\ndef detect_narrative_combat_completion(game_state, recent_turns):\n    \"\"\"Detect informal combat that should trigger rewards.\"\"\"\n    indicators = {\n        \"attack_rolls\": count_attack_rolls(recent_turns),\n        \"damage_dealt\": sum_damage_rolls(recent_turns),\n        \"enemies_defeated\": extract_defeated_enemies(recent_turns),\n        \"combat_keywords\": has_combat_completion_keywords(recent_turns)\n    }\n    \n    if (indicators[\"attack_rolls\"] >= 3 \n        and indicators[\"enemies_defeated\"] \n        and indicators[\"combat_keywords\"]):\n        return True\n    return False\n```", "status": "open", "priority": 2, "issue_type": "feature", "created_at": "2025-12-26T22:44:08.372316-05:00", "updated_at": "2025-12-26T22:49:03.865996-05:00", "source_repo": ".", "labels": ["agent", "non-combat", "rewards", "xp"]}
