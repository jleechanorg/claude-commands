Every test must either:\n\n1. **RUN** - Execute with real or mocked dependencies\n2. **FAIL LOUDLY** - Raise clear assertion error if prerequisites missing\n3. **MOCK** - Use mock objects when real services unavailable\n\n**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS:**\n- `if not os.getenv(\"X\"): return` (silent skip)\n- Module-level imports that raise on missing env vars (blocks test collection)\n- `@unittest.skipIf/skipUnless` without CI-compatible fallback\n- Tests that pass trivially when env var is unset\n\n**REQUIRED PATTERNS:**\n- `TESTING=true` should enable mock mode for all external services\n- Test collection must NEVER fail due to env vars\n- All tests must run in CI without special env vars beyond TESTING=true\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n- CI passes falsely when tests are skipped\n- Bugs slip through because code paths never execute\n- Developers think tests pass when they actually didn't run","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"chore","created_at":"2025-12-11T06:01:03.763015-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-11T06:01:03.763015-05:00","source_repo":".","labels":["ci","policy","testing"]}

This triggers `validate_deployment_config()` which raises `ValueError` if `WORLDAI_GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` is set without `WORLDAI_DEV_MODE=true`.\n\n**Impact:**\n- Test collection fails for any test that imports `world_logic`\n- CI \"passes\" because CI doesn't have the env var - tests never run\n- Local devs with service account keys cannot run tests without setting extra env vars\n\n**Files Affected:**\n- `mvp_site/clock_skew_credentials.py:40-44` - The raising code\n- `mvp_site/world_logic.py:35` - Module-level call to `apply_clock_skew_patch()`\n- `mvp_site/tests/test_game_state.py:88` - Import fails here\n\n**Root Cause:**\nValidation logic runs at import time, not runtime. This is a design flaw - module imports should NEVER raise based on env vars.\n\n**Fix Required:**\n1. Make `validate_deployment_config()` return status, not raise\n2. OR defer validation until actual Firebase operation\n3. OR respect `TESTING=true` to skip validation entirely","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] Tests can be collected without WORLDAI_DEV_MODE\n- [ ] TESTING=true bypasses clock skew validation\n- [ ] test_game_state.py runs in CI\n- [ ] Local devs can run tests with service account keys","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-11T06:01:18.00365-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-11T06:03:03.560481-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-11T06:03:03.560481-05:00","source_repo":".","labels":["bug","p0","testing"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"worktree_worker3-sn2","depends_on_id":"worktree_worker3-1hz","type":"related","created_at":"2025-12-11T06:01:23.566645-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
