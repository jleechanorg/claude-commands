# Claude Commands

A comprehensive collection of workflow automation commands for Claude Code that transform your development process through intelligent command composition and orchestration.

## Installation

To install Claude Commands in Claude Code CLI, first register the marketplace:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add jleechanorg/claude-commands
```

Then browse available commands with `/plugin` and install:

```bash
/plugin install claude-commands@claude-commands
```

After installation, restart your Claude Code CLI session for the plugin to take effect.

To verify successful installation, run `/help` to check that commands appear.

### Alternative: Intelligent Self-Setup

Let Claude Code analyze and set up what you need by asking:

```text
"I want to use commands from https://github.com/jleechanorg/claude-commands - analyze what's available and set up the ones useful for my project"
```

### Alternative: Manual Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jleechanorg/claude-commands.git
cp -r claude-commands/.claude/commands/* ./.claude/commands/
```

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for detailed setup, troubleshooting, and platform-specific instructions.

⚠️ **PROTOTYPE WIP REPOSITORY** - This is an experimental command system exported from a working development environment. Use as reference but expect adaptation needed for your specific setup.

## 🎯 What's Included

**195+ Commands** including powerful workflow orchestrators and cognitive tools:
- **Workflow Orchestrators**: `/pr`, `/copilot`, `/execute`, `/orch` - Complete multi-step automation
- **Cognitive Commands**: `/think`, `/arch`, `/debug`, `/learn` - Analysis and planning
- **Infrastructure**: `/scaffold` - Repository setup and development environment
- **Testing**: `/test`, `/tdd`, `/testuif` - Comprehensive testing workflows

**43 Hooks** for Claude Code automation and workflow optimization

**19 Scripts** for development tools including git workflow, code analysis, testing, and CI/CD

**33 Skills** providing shared knowledge references and capabilities

## 🔍 Key Commands

### `/execute` - Plan-Approve-Execute Workflow

Combines planning, auto-approval, and implementation in one seamless workflow with progress tracking.

```bash
/execute "fix login button styling"
# → Creates plan → Auto-approves → Implements → Tests → Commits
```

### `/pr` - Complete Development Lifecycle

Executes the full 5-phase development workflow from analysis to PR creation.

```bash
/pr "fix authentication bug"
# Think → Execute → Push → Copilot → Review
```

### `/copilot` - Autonomous PR Management

Targets current branch PR and autonomously handles analysis, fixes, testing, and communication.

```bash
/copilot  # Auto-targets current branch PR
# → Analyze → Fix → Test → Document → Reply → Verify
```

### `/cerebras` - High-Speed Code Generation

Hybrid workflow using Cerebras Inference API (19.6x faster) with Claude as architect and Cerebras as builder.

```bash
/cerebras "create React component for user dashboard with TypeScript"
# → 500ms generation time vs 10s standard
```

### `/orch` - Multi-Agent Task Delegation

Delegates tasks to autonomous agents working in parallel across different branches.

```bash
/orch "add user notifications system"
# → Frontend, Backend, and Testing agents work in parallel
```

### `/scaffold` - Repository Infrastructure Setup

Rapidly scaffolds essential development infrastructure with intelligent technology stack adaptation.

```bash
/scaffold
# → Copies 17 development scripts adapted to your tech stack
```

## 💡 Command Composition Architecture

Commands work through **simple .md files** that Claude Code reads as executable instructions. You can chain multiple commands in a single request:

```bash
# Sequential execution
"/think about authentication then /arch the solution then /execute it"

# Conditional execution
"/test the login flow and if it fails /fix it then /pr the changes"

# Full workflow composition
"/analyze the codebase /design a solution /execute with tests /pr with documentation"
```

### How It Works

When you type `/pr "fix bug"`, Claude:
1. **Reads** `.claude/commands/pr.md`
2. **Parses** the structured prompt template
3. **Executes** the workflow defined in the markdown
4. **Composes** with other commands through shared protocols

Commands integrate seamlessly through:
- **TodoWrite**: All commands break down into trackable steps
- **Memory Enhancement**: Commands learn from previous executions
- **Git Workflow**: Automatic branch management and PR creation
- **Error Recovery**: Smart handling of failures and retries

## 🧪 Testing Framework

LLM-Native test patterns that work across any web application using AI to create, execute, and validate complex test scenarios.

**Commands**: `/test`, `/tdd`, `/testuif`, `/testhttp`

**Capabilities**:
- Multi-domain test patterns (e-commerce, authentication, content management)
- AI-first test development with intelligent generation
- Dynamic assertion creation and failure analysis
- Matrix testing for comprehensive validation

## 🚧 WIP: Orchestration System

Multi-agent task delegation prototype demonstrating autonomous development workflows.

**Architecture**:
- Frontend, Backend, Testing, and Opus-Master agents
- Redis-based coordination and task management
- Individual PR creation per agent with branch isolation
- Cost: $0.003-$0.050 per task

**Performance**: 85% first-time-right with proper specs, 90% cross-agent coordination success

## 🎯 Adaptation Guide

Commands contain placeholders that need adaptation for your project:
- `$PROJECT_ROOT/` → Your project's main directory
- `your-project.com` → Your domain/project name
- `TESTING=true python` → Your test execution pattern

**Example**:
```bash
# Before (exported)
TESTING=true python $PROJECT_ROOT/test_file.py

# After (adapted for Node.js)
npm test src/components/test_file.js
```

## 📚 Command Categories

- **Workflow Orchestrators**: Complete multi-step workflows
- **Cognitive Commands**: Analysis and planning capabilities
- **Infrastructure Commands**: Repository setup and configuration
