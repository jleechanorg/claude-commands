  "dragon_knight_narrative": "You are Ser Arion, a 16 year old honorable knight on your first mission, sworn to protect the vast Celestial Imperium. For decades, the Empire has been ruled by the iron-willed Empress Sariel, a ruthless tyrant who uses psychic power to crush dissent. While her methods are terrifying, her reign has brought undeniable benefits: the roads are safe, commerce thrives, and the Imperium has never been stronger. But dark whispers speak of the Dragon Knights - an ancient order that once served the realm before mysteriously vanishing. As you journey through this morally complex world, you must decide: will you serve the tyrant who brings order, or seek a different path?",
