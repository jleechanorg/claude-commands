Quality of the consolidation approach\n2. Any remaining opportunities for further consolidation \n3. Impact on codebase maintainability\n4. Code coverage and testing implications\n5. Documentation completeness\n\nFocus on the specific changes made:\n- Removed redundant campaign management scripts (find_user_by_email.py, query_campaigns_by_name.py, delete_campaigns_by_name.py)\n- Removed redundant import detection scripts (detect_test_imports.py, final_inline_detector.py) \n- Updated README_campaign_tools.md to reflect consolidations\n\nProvide recommendations for any additional improvements or consolidations that could be made.",
