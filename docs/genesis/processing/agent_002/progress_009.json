Untracked Files Analysis\n- Check for untracked files in working directory\n- Intelligently analyze file context and relevance to current PR work\n- Interactive selection for files to include\n- Auto-suggest appropriate commit messages\n\n### 2. `/review` - Code Quality Gate\n- Execute `/review` command for comprehensive code analysis\n- Virtual [AI reviewer] performs systematic quality assessment\n- Identifies bugs, security issues, performance problems, best practice violations\n- Posts categorized review comments if issues found\n- **Push blocked if critical issues detected**\n\n### 3. Git Operations\n- Validate commit messages and git state\n- Push to remote only if `/review` passes quality checks\n- Create PR if needed for new branches\n- Verify push success and remote synchronization\n\n### 4. PR Description Auto-Update\n- Analyze commits since PR creation for significant changes\n- Update PR description to reflect current implementation state\n- Preserve existing test results and documentation\n\n### 5. `/testserver` - Production Environment Setup\n- Execute `/testserver start` for current branch\n- Automatic port allocation and conflict resolution\n- Branch-specific logging and process management\n- Production-like environment initialization\n\n### 6. Production Readiness Verification\n- Health check endpoints validation\n- Server startup verification and accessibility testing\n- Log monitoring for critical errors\n- Production deployment checklist completion\n\n## Workflow Details\n\n### Full Production Pipeline\n```\n1. Untracked file handling \u2192 Prepare complete changeset\n2. /review execution \u2192 Quality assessment & issue detection\n3. Quality gate check \u2192 Pass/fail determination\n4. Git operations \u2192 Push only if quality checks pass\n5. PR updates \u2192 Maintain project documentation\n6. /testserver start \u2192 Production environment setup\n7. Production verification \u2192 Readiness validation\n```\n\n### Review Integration\n- **Quality Threshold**: Critical and important issues block push\n- **Suggestion/Nitpick**: Warnings logged but don't block push\n- **Review Comments**: Posted to PR for visibility and tracking\n- **Status Reporting**: Clear indication of review results\n\n## Untracked Files Handling\n\n**Intelligent File Analysis**:\n- Test files matching PR work (e.g., `test_*.py`, `test_*.js`)\n- Documentation updates related to changes\n- Supporting scripts or utilities\n- Configuration or schema files\n\n**Interactive Options**:\n1. **Add all relevant** - Add files that appear related to PR work\n2. **Select specific** - Choose individual files to include\n3. **Skip** - Continue without adding untracked files\n4. **Abort** - Cancel push to manually review files\n\n**Auto-Suggested Commit Messages**:\n- \"Add JavaScript unit tests for [feature]\"\n- \"Add browser tests for [functionality]\"\n- \"Add supporting test utilities\"\n- \"Update documentation for [changes]\"\n\n## PR Description Auto-Update\n\n**Change Detection**:\n- Architecture migrations (e.g., string \u2192 JSON)\n- New test protocols or policies\n- Breaking changes and compatibility impacts\n- Major feature additions or modifications\n\n**Update Behavior**:\n- Preserves existing test results and links\n- Adds new test outcomes and metrics\n- Includes breaking change warnings if applicable\n- Maintains PR history and context\n\n## Test Server Integration via `/testserver`\n\n**Production-Ready Server Management**:\n- Executes `/testserver start` with current branch context\n- Automatic port allocation (8081, 8082, 8083, etc.)\n- Branch-specific process isolation and management\n- Production-like configuration and environment setup\n\n**Advanced Features**:\n- PID tracking and process lifecycle management\n- Conflict detection and automatic resolution\n- Cleanup of stale processes from previous sessions\n- Integration with development workflow state\n\n**Server Accessibility**:\n- Server accessible at `http://localhost:[allocated_port]`\n- Logs stored in `/tmp/worldarchitectai_logs/[branch].log`\n- Real-time monitoring and health checking\n- Automatic restart on critical failures\n\n## Production Readiness Verification\n\n**Health Check Protocol**:\n- Server startup verification (response within 30 seconds)\n- Basic endpoint accessibility testing\n- Critical error detection in startup logs\n- Database connection and API availability validation\n\n**Production Checklist**:\n- \u2705 Code quality review passed\n- \u2705 Git operations completed successfully\n- \u2705 PR documentation updated\n- \u2705 Test server started and responsive\n- \u2705 No critical errors in logs\n- \u2705 Basic functionality verification\n\n**Deployment Readiness Report**:\n- Branch deployment status summary\n- Server accessibility details (URL, port, logs)\n- Quality assessment results\n- Any warnings or issues requiring attention\n\n## Quality Gate Behavior\n\n### Review Results \u2192 Push Decision\n- **\ud83d\udd34 Critical Issues**: Push blocked, must fix before proceeding\n- **\ud83d\udfe1 Important Issues**: Push blocked, requires attention\n- **\ud83d\udd35 Suggestions**: Push allowed with warnings logged\n- **\ud83d\udfe2 Nitpicks**: Push allowed, comments posted for improvement\n- **\u2705 Clean Review**: Push proceeds to production setup\n\n### Production Gate Behavior\n- **\ud83d\udd34 Server Failed**: Deployment blocked, investigate logs\n- **\ud83d\udfe1 Warnings Detected**: Deployment proceeds with monitoring\n- **\u2705 All Systems Green**: Production-ready deployment complete\n\n### Error Handling\n- Clear reporting of blocking issues with specific locations\n- Actionable feedback for resolving quality and deployment problems\n- Option to override for emergency pushes (with confirmation)\n- Comprehensive logging of review results and deployment status\n\n## Benefits of Full Production Mode\n\n- **End-to-End Quality**: From code review to running production environment\n- **Deployment Confidence**: Every push includes production readiness verification\n- **Automated Setup**: No manual server management or configuration\n- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Full visibility into code quality and deployment status\n- **Production Parity**: Development environment matches production characteristics\n- **Fail-Fast Principle**: Issues detected before they reach production\n- **Streamlined Workflow**: Single command for complete development-to-deployment pipeline\n\n## Command Dependencies\n\n- **`/review`**: Code quality analysis and review comment generation\n- **`/testserver`**: Production environment setup and server management\n- **Git operations**: Version control and remote synchronization\n- **PR management**: GitHub integration and documentation updates\n\n\nARGUMENTS: to pr and use /gst to ensure your commit went through",
