The prompt for secondary models is generated after secondary opinions are collected, so the generated prompt is never used. This makes the prompt generation call wasteful and risks malforming the final synthesis prompt if it fails. Also, the multi-model-synthesis-prompt-gen model name is unmapped in the CostCalculator, leading to inaccurate cost reporting.\n\nFix in Cursor Fix in Web\n\n@jleechan2015    Reply...\nPrimary Response (${primaryResponse.model}):\n${truncatedPrimary}\n@@ -646,31 +678,29 @@\n${index + 1}. ${resp.model}: ${resp.response}\n`).join('')}\nNote: The synthesis should acknowledge any failed responses and work with available information.\nNote: Account for any failed responses in your analysis.\n` : ''}\nInstructions:\n1.
