We need to:\n\n1. **Check Agent Results**: Verify what file modifications were completed by the copilot-fixpr agent\n2. **Handle New Comment**: Address cursor bot comment #2332250151 about \"Temporary Debug Files Accumulate, Exposing Sensitive Data\"\n3. **Complete Integration**: Ensure all security fixes are properly integrated\n4. **Generate Response**: Create technical response for the new cursor bot comment\n\n**CRITICAL ISSUE TO ADDRESS**:\n- **Comment #2332250151 (cursor[bot])**: \"Temporary Debug Files Accumulate, Exposing Sensitive Data\"\n- **Location**: `.claude/commands/cerebras/cerebras_direct.sh` lines 401-408\n- **Required Fix**: Extend cleanup() function to handle debug files\n\n**WORKFLOW**:\n1. Check current state of cerebras_direct.sh cleanup function\n2. Implement debug file cleanup if not already done\n3. Generate technical response explaining the fix\n4. Complete Phase 2 integration\n\n**DELIVERABLES**:\n- Fixed cleanup function that handles debug files\n- Technical response for cursor bot comment\n- Integration status report\n\nWork autonomously and provide comprehensive results for the final copilot phase completion.",

Slack returns 404/410 when a webhook is revoked or the URL is mistyped, yet curl still exits with code 0, so the hook reports success while the message is discarded.

Add --fail-with-body (or --fail) so non-2xx statuses cause a non-zero exit.\n\nCopilot uses AI.

Add a preflight check (e.g., if ! command -v jq >/dev/null 2>&1; then echo \"\u26a0\ufe0f jq not found; skipping Slack notification\"; exit 0; fi) before using jq, or provide a small fallback JSON escaper.\n\nCopilot uses AI.

Slack returns 404/410 when a webhook is revoked or the URL is mistyped, yet curl still exits with code 0, so the hook reports success while the message is discarded. Consider adding --fail (or inspecting the HTTP status) so that invalid or expired webhooks surface as errors instead of silently dropping notifications.\n\nUseful?

Add --fail-with-body (or --fail) so non-2xx statuses cause a non-zero exit.\n\nCopilot uses AI.

Add a preflight check (e.g., if ! command -v jq >/dev/null 2>&1; then echo \"\u26a0\ufe0f jq not found; skipping Slack notification\"; exit 0; fi) before using jq, or provide a small fallback JSON escaper.\n\nCopilot uses AI.
