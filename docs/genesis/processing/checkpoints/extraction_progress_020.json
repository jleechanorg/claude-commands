Because the shell redirection (copilot-fixpr-agent > \"$AGENT_STATUS\" &) creates the file immediately, the while [ ! -f \"$AGENT_STATUS\" ] && kill -0 $AGENT_PID loop can skip entirely even though the agent is still running, and the subsequent if [ -f \"$AGENT_STATUS\" ]; then ... branch reports success. The same happens when a timeout kills the agent\u2014the file still exists so the code prints \u201cAgent completed successfully\u201d and the orchestrator continues with partial or corrupt data. The race condition therefore remains, and failures are silently treated as success. This block needs to wait for the background PID and check its exit status instead of relying on file existence.\n\nUseful?

This also creates a conflict with the expectation that the agent writes a structured JSON status file, as redirecting its stdout could corrupt the JSON with other output.

Key improvements:\n\nReplaced unreliable agent command with direct Task agent invocation via Claude's agent system\nAdded comprehensive error handling with cleanup functions and trap statements\nImplemented secure process management following shell=False, timeout=30 patterns\nAdded validation checkpoints to ensure agent completion before proceeding\nThe documented approach now uses Task agents which are actual executable components, not placeholder documentation.\n\nCommit: 8685f93 + additional security enhancements in latest commits.\n\n@jleechan2015 Reply...\n.claude/commands/copilot.md\nComment on lines +164 to +165\n# Remove null bytes and escape shell metacharacters\nlocal sanitized=$(echo \"$input\" | tr -d '\\0' | sed 's/[`$\\\\]/\\\\&/g' | sed 's/[;&|]/\\\\&/g')\nCopilot AI\n40 minutes ago\nThe sanitization function escapes shell metacharacters but may not be sufficient for all contexts.
