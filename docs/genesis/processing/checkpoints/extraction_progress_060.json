Does the /context integration actually work as described? \n2. Are the context percentage thresholds (60%+, 30-60%, <30%) realistic and practical?\n3. Will the tool selection hierarchy actually preserve context as claimed?\n4. Are the universal composition examples accurate and implementable?\n\nPRACTICAL CONCERNS:\n1. Will users actually follow the mandatory /context check, or will they skip it?\n2. Is the context-adaptive complexity realistic in practice?\n3. Are there edge cases where this approach could fail?\n4. Does this create too much cognitive overhead for users?\n5. Will the simplified structure actually improve instruction adherence?\n\nIMPLEMENTATION REALITY CHECK:\n1. Can Claude actually execute /context commands as described?\n2. Do the Serena MCP \u2192 Read \u2192 /cerebras tool selections work in practice?\n3. Are the time estimates and efficiency claims realistic?\n4. Will the \"universal composition\" actually work seamlessly?\n\nPOTENTIAL PROBLEMS:\n1. What could go wrong with this approach?\n2. Are there scenarios where context-aware planning would be counterproductive?\n3. Could this create confusion or workflow disruption?\n4. Are there missing safeguards or error handling considerations?\n\nBe brutally honest about practical viability. Will this actually work well in real usage, or are there fundamental flaws that could cause problems?",
