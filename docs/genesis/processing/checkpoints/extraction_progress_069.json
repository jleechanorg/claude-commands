Security vulnerabilities\n# 2. Runtime errors\n# 3. Test failures\n# 4. Style/quality issues\n```\n\n**Parallel copilot-fixpr Agent:**\n- Launch agent for file modifications with File Justification Protocol\n- Agent analyzes security vulnerabilities and implements fixes\n- Agent uses Edit/MultiEdit tools for actual code changes\n- Agent must verify target files exist before modifications\n\n**\ud83d\udea8 PHASE 1 VERIFICATION (MANDATORY):**\n```bash\n# Hard stop: Verify agent made actual changes\nCHANGES=$(git diff --name-only | wc -l)\n[ \"$CHANGES\" -eq 0 ] && echo \"\ud83d\udea8 AGENT FAILURE: No files modified\" && exit 1\necho \"\u2705 Verified: $CHANGES files modified\"\ngit diff --stat\n```\n\n### Phase 2: Response Generation\n\n**Integration & Communication:**\n- Collect agent results: technical analysis, file fixes, security implementations\n- Generate responses based on actual implemented changes\n- Execute /commentreply with implementation details for guaranteed GitHub posting\n\n**\ud83d\udea8 PHASE 2 VERIFICATION (MANDATORY):**\n```bash\n# Verify both changes and comment processing completed\n[ -z \"$(git diff --name-only)\" ] && echo \"\ud83d\udea8 NO MODIFICATIONS\" && exit 1\n[ ! -f \"/tmp/copilot_comments_fetched\" ] && /commentfetch && touch /tmp/copilot_comments_fetched\n```\n\n### Phase 3: Verification & Push\n\n**\ud83d\udea8 MANDATORY VERIFICATION PROTOCOL:**\n```bash\n# Show evidence of changes\necho \"\ud83d\udcca COPILOT EXECUTION EVIDENCE:\"\necho \"\ud83d\udd27 FILES MODIFIED:\"\ngit diff --name-only | sed 's/^/  - /'\necho \"\ud83d\udcc8 CHANGE SUMMARY:\"\ngit diff --stat\n\n# Push changes to PR\n/pushl || { echo \"\ud83d\udea8 PUSH FAILED: PR not updated\"; exit 1; }\n```\n\n**Coverage Tracking:**\n```bash\n# Coverage verification (silent unless incomplete)\nREPO=\"$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner 2>/dev/null)\"\nPR_NUMBER=\"$(gh pr view --json number -q .number 2>/dev/null)\"\n\n# Input validation\n[[ ! \"$REPO\" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9._/-]+$ ]] || [[ ! \"$PR_NUMBER\" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] && echo \"\ud83d\udea8 INVALID REPO/PR\" && exit 1\n\n# Calculate coverage\nREV_JSON=\"$(gh api \"repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/comments\" --paginate 2>/dev/null | jq -s 'add // []' 2>/dev/null)\"\nREV_ORIGINAL=\"$(jq -r '[.[] | select(.in_reply_to_id == null)] | length' <<<\"$REV_JSON\")\"\nUNIQUE_REPLIED_ORIGINALS=\"$(jq -r '[.[] | select(.in_reply_to_id != null) | .in_reply_to_id] | unique | length' <<<\"$REV_JSON\")\"\n\nORIGINAL_COMMENTS=\"${REV_ORIGINAL:-0}\"\nREPLIED_ORIGINALS=\"${UNIQUE_REPLIED_ORIGINALS:-0}\"\n\n[[ ! \"$ORIGINAL_COMMENTS\" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] && ORIGINAL_COMMENTS=0\n[[ ! \"$REPLIED_ORIGINALS\" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] && REPLIED_ORIGINALS=0\n\nif [ \"${ORIGINAL_COMMENTS:-0}\" -gt 0 ]; then\n  COVERAGE_PERCENT=$(( REPLIED_ORIGINALS * 100 / ORIGINAL_COMMENTS ))\n  if [ \"$COVERAGE_PERCENT\" -lt 100 ]; then\n    missing=$(( ORIGINAL_COMMENTS - REPLIED_ORIGINALS ))\n    [ \"$missing\" -lt 0 ] && missing=0\n    echo \"\ud83d\udea8 WARNING: INCOMPLETE COVERAGE: ${COVERAGE_PERCENT}% (missing: ${missing})\"\n  fi\nfi\n```\n\n**Final Timing:**\n```bash\nCOPILOT_END_TIME=$(date +%s)\nCOPILOT_DURATION=$((COPILOT_END_TIME - COPILOT_START_TIME))\n[ \"${COPILOT_DURATION:-0}\" -gt 180 ] && echo \"\u26a0\ufe0f PERFORMANCE: ${COPILOT_DURATION}s exceeded 3m target\"\n\n/guidelines\n```\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 Agent Boundaries\n\n**copilot-fixpr Agent:**\n- File operations only (Edit/MultiEdit, security fixes)\n- Must verify file existence before modifications\n- Must run `git diff --stat` before reporting success\n\n**Direct Orchestrator:**\n- Comment processing (/commentfetch, /commentreply)\n- GitHub operations and workflow coordination\n- Verification checkpoints and evidence collection\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Success Criteria\n\n**BOTH REQUIRED:**\n1. **Implementation**: All actionable issues have actual file changes\n2. **Communication**: 100% comment response rate\n\n**FAILURE CONDITIONS:**\n- No file changes after agent execution\n- Missing comment responses\n- Push failures\n- Skipped verification checkpoints\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 Critical Anti-Patterns\n- \u274c Agent reports success but `git diff` shows no changes\n- \u274c Agent targets non-existent files (app.py vs main.py)\n- \u274c Skipping /commentfetch or /commentreply workflows\n- \u274c Declaring completion without /pushl execution\n- \u274c Accepting \"implemented\" without git evidence",
