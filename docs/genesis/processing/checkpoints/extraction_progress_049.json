After comprehensive multi-perspective analysis including technical assessment, research validation, design thinking, and architectural review, the recommendation is to **preserve and enhance the architecture** rather than replace it with industry frameworks.\n\n\n**Overall Ecosystem Rating: 8.1/10** (solo developer context)\n\n\n**Core Insight**: System optimized for N=1 developer productivity.

CORS is working: The health check URL is accessible, which means CORS is properly configured\n  2. Backend is healthy: The /health endpoint is responding correctly\n  3. Frontend issue: The error shows:\n    - 404 error for /vite.svg - missing frontend asset\n    - Frontend is stuck on \"Getting AI responses...\" - suggests the frontend isn't properly handling the API responses\n\n  The Problem:\n\n  The frontend is likely:\n  - Not correctly calling the backend API endpoints\n  - Not handling the streaming responses properly\n  - Missing proper error handling for API calls\n  - Possibly calling the wrong endpoint URLs\n\n  What to check in the frontend:\n\n  1. API endpoint URLs - Make sure they're pointing to the correct backend URL\n  2. Streaming implementation - The backend uses streaming responses via /mcp endpoint\n  3. Error handling - Frontend should handle API errors gracefully\n  4. Network requests - Check browser dev tools to see what actual requests are being made\n\n  The backend is working correctly (health checks pass, CORS headers present), so the issue is in how the frontend is communicating with the backend or handling the\n  responses.",

Benefits of Using MCP SDK\n\n  1. Type Safety: Full TypeScript support with proper types\n  2. Connection Management: Automatic reconnection and error handling\n  3. Streaming Support: Built-in SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport\n  4. Protocol Compliance: Follows MCP specification exactly\n  5. Error Handling: Proper MCP error propagation\n  6. Resource Management: Automatic cleanup and connection lifecycle\n\n  6. Alternative Transports\n\n  The SDK also supports other transports if needed:\n\n  // WebSocket transport (if backend supported it)\n  import { WebSocketClientTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/websocket.js';\n\n  // HTTP transport (for request/response)\n  import { HTTPClientTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/http.js';\n\n  \u2705 Recommendation\n\n  Yes, absolutely use the MCP TypeScript SDK! It's:\n  - Purpose-built for MCP protocol\n  - Handles streaming automatically\n  - Provides proper error handling\n  - Type-safe and well-maintained\n  - Much more robust than manual fetch calls\n\n  This will solve the \"Getting AI responses...\" stuck state because the SDK properly handles the MCP protocol communication with your backend.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n>",

      "content": "we are supposed to be using streamable http. is your code using that? ### What is Streamable HTTP?\n\nStreamable HTTP is a transport protocol in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) designed for efficient, bidirectional communication between MCP clients and servers, particularly suited for web-based and remote applications. Unlike Server-Sent Events (SSE), which is unidirectional (server-to-client), Streamable HTTP supports full-duplex streaming, enabling real-time interactions like tool calls, resource access, and elicitation (user input prompts) over a single HTTP connection. It\u2019s the recommended transport for modern MCP implementations (as of 2025), replacing SSE for better performance and flexibility in web environments. Key features include:\n\n- **Bidirectional**: Supports simultaneous client-to-server and server-to-client data streams.\n- **Web-Friendly**: Works over standard HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2, with CORS support for browser clients.\n- **Efficiency**: Reduces overhead compared to SSE by reusing connections and supporting chunked transfers.\n- **Use Case**: Ideal for web apps, remote AI agents, or integrations with LLMs like Claude, where low-latency, two-way communication is needed.\n\nIn the context of FastMCP (from your previous question), Streamable HTTP is the default transport for web-based MCP servers, typically exposed at an endpoint like `/mcp/` (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/mcp/`).\n\n### Prompt for Claude Code CLI Agents to Use Streamable HTTP\n\nTo instruct your Claude-based CLI agents to use Streamable HTTP with an MCP server (e.g., powered by FastMCP), you need a clear, concise prompt that specifies the configuration and intent. Claude, being an LLM, excels at understanding structured instructions, so the prompt should include the transport type, server details, and desired agent behavior. Below is a tailored prompt for your Claude code CLI agents:\n\n---\n\n**Prompt for Claude CLI Agents**:\n\n\"Act as an expert developer configuring an MCP client for a CLI-based AI agent. Update the agent to connect to an MCP server using the Streamable HTTP transport protocol. The server is running FastMCP at `http://localhost:8000/mcp/`. Ensure the agent can:\n1. Connect to the MCP server using Streamable HTTP.\n2. List available tools and resources.\n3. Execute a sample tool call (e.g., an 'add' tool that takes two integers and returns their sum).\n4. Handle errors gracefully (e.g., connection issues or invalid responses).\nUse TypeScript or Python code, depending on the agent's environment, and include comments for clarity. If authentication is required, assume OAuth 2.1 with PKCE is available but not yet configured\u2014note where to add credentials. Test the connection and print the results to the console.\"\n\n---\n\n### Example Implementation (TypeScript)\n\nTo give you a sense of what Claude might generate based on this prompt, here\u2019s an example TypeScript implementation for a CLI agent using the official MCP TypeScript SDK with Streamable HTTP:\n\n```typescript\nimport { McpClient } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk';\nimport { exit } from 'process';\n\nasync function connectToMcpServer() {\n  // Initialize MCP client with Streamable HTTP transport\n  const client = new McpClient({\n    transport: {\n      type: 'streamable-http',\n      url: 'http://localhost:8000/mcp/',\n      // Add OAuth 2.1 PKCE credentials here if required, e.g.:\n      // auth: { type: 'oauth2', clientId: '...', tokenUrl: '...' }\n    },\n  });\n\n  try {\n    // Connect to the MCP server\n    console.log('Connecting to MCP server at http://localhost:8000/mcp/...');\n    await client.connect();\n\n    // List available tools\n    const tools = await client.listTools();\n    console.log('Available tools:', tools);\n\n    // Example: Call an 'add' tool if it exists\n    if (tools.some((tool) => tool.name === 'add')) {\n      const result = await client.callTool('add', { a: 5, b: 3 });\n      console.log('Result of add(5, 3):', result);\n    } else {\n      console.log('Add tool not found.');\n    }\n\n    // Disconnect gracefully\n    await client.disconnect();\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error interacting with MCP server:', error.message);\n    exit(1);\n  }\n}\n\n// Run the agent\nconnectToMcpServer();\n```\n\n### Notes for Claude CLI Agents\n- **Environment**: Ensure the MCP server (e.g., FastMCP) is running with `transport=\"http\"` (Python: `mcp.run(transport=\"http\", host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=8000)`). The `/mcp/` endpoint is standard for Streamable HTTP.\n- **Authentication**: If your server requires OAuth, include the `auth` configuration in the client setup. Claude can generate code to handle PKCE flow if you specify credentials.\n- **Testing**: Run the server locally first and verify the `/mcp/` endpoint is accessible (e.g., via `curl http://localhost:8000/mcp/`).\n- **Claude Optimization**: The prompt is designed to leverage Claude\u2019s ability to generate clean, commented code. If your agents use a specific framework (e.g., LangChain.js or a custom CLI wrapper), mention it in the prompt for tailored output.\n- **Fallback to SSE**: If Streamable HTTP fails (e.g., server not updated), you can modify the prompt to try SSE (`transport: 'sse', url: 'http://localhost:8000/sse'`), but Streamable HTTP is preferred for 2025 MCP specs.\n\n### Additional Tips\n- **Debugging**: Check server logs and ensure CORS is enabled if the agent runs in a browser-like CLI environment.\n- **Docs**: Refer to [FastMCP GitHub](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp) or [MCP Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) for endpoint and transport details.\n- **Prompt Refinement**: If Claude generates suboptimal code (e.g., missing error handling), add to the prompt: \"Include try-catch blocks and validate tool responses with Zod schemas.\"\n\nIf you need a Python version, a modified prompt for a specific CLI framework, or help with server setup, let me know!",
