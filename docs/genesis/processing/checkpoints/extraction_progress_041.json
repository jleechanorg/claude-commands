Avoid using outdated research when evaluating modern solutions.\n**Parameters**:\n- `feature-name`: Name of the feature/component to design\n- `--type`: Optional type for customized templates (default: feature)\n- Use `lets make a new test plan in docs/ thats just an md file. I want to describe a serious of projects starting from small to large. Then I want two subagents without any shared context for this convo. three actually. 1) will not use cerebras to generate and just do normal code gen 2) will be instructed to use cerebras but will not have the mcp. 3) will have the mcp to use. I want to evaluate the speed of code gen for each one and the quality. Lets have them work in subdir of this current dir but gitignore the the new worktrees. I want them to use indep worktrees. We can consider using /conv for each subagent. First lets make the plan using cerebras and refine using anthropic models. dont execute yet` in templates for team customization\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f **Selective Documentation Principle**\n\n**SKIP sections that don't apply** - Don't force irrelevant content:\n- **Bug fixes**: Skip user stories, focus on technical analysis\n- **Infrastructure**: Skip UI/UX, focus on system design\n- **Small features**: Skip risk assessment if trivial\n- **Internal tools**: Skip user journey maps\n\n**Quality over completeness** - Empty sections with good reason > Forced placeholder content\n\n### **Section Relevance by Type**\n- **Features**: Full product spec + engineering design\n- **Bug fixes**: Focus on technical analysis, testing strategy, minimal product spec\n- **Migrations**: Emphasize risk assessment, rollout plan, minimal UI requirements\n- **Refactoring**: Focus on technical goals, success metrics, skip user stories\n- **Infrastructure**: System design, monitoring, automation hooks - skip user journeys\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Command Objectives\n\n1. **Requirements First**: Start with `/requirements-start` to gather structured requirements through guided questions\n2. **Prevent Issues Like React V2**: Enforce proper planning before implementation\n3. **Feature Completeness**: Ensure all requirements are captured upfront\n4. **Technical Clarity**: Define implementation approach before coding\n5. **Success Criteria**: Clear definition of \"done\" before starting\n6. **Methodology Enforcement**: Mandate /4layer, /tdd, /redgreen for quality\n7. **Multi-Perspective Validation**: Combine architecture analysis with principal-level product and engineering expertise  \n8. **Current Industry Standards**: Validate approach against 2025 best practices and emerging technologies\n9. **TDD Implementation Planning**: Generate detailed sub-milestone breakdown with test-driven development integration\n10. **Granular Progress Tracking**: Break features into ~100 line commits for better tracking and rollback safety\n\n## \ud83d\udccb Requirements Gathering Integration\n\nThe `/design` command now starts with `/requirements-start` to ensure comprehensive requirements are captured before creating design documents:\n\n1. **Discovery Phase**: 5 yes/no questions to understand the problem space\n2. **Context Analysis**: Autonomous codebase analysis to identify technical constraints\n3. **Expert Questions**: 5 detailed yes/no questions based on findings\n4. **Requirements Spec**: Generated requirements feed into design documents\n\nThis ensures design documents are grounded in validated requirements gathered through systematic questioning.\n\n## \ud83d\udd04 Session Continuity\n\n**Link to Previous Work**: Reference related design decisions, previous sprints, and architectural choices to maintain development continuity across sessions.\n\n**Team Integration**: All documents are git-friendly and can be shared across team members for collaborative development.\n\n## \ud83d\udccb Generated Documents\n\nThe `/design` command now generates **3 comprehensive documents** with TDD integration:\n\n### 1.

Technical approach and system design\n2. **Product Strategy Review** (`/principalproductmanager`): User experience and business value\n3. **Engineering Leadership** (`/principalengineer`): Technical excellence and scalability\n4. **Critical Thinking** (`/thinku`): Challenge assumptions and identify risks\n5. **Current Research** (`/research [current_date_search]`): 2025 industry standards and best practices\n\n### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering\n1. **Identify Feature Scope**: What are we building?\n2. **User Research**: Who uses this and why?\n3. **Existing Analysis**: What exists today (if migration)?\n4. **Success Definition**: When is it \"done\"?\n5. **Industry Validation**: How do current (2025) best practices inform our approach?\n\n### Phase 2: Document Generation\n1. **Create Product Spec**: User-focused requirements\n2. **Create Eng Design**: Technical implementation details\n3. **Cross-Validate**: Ensure eng design satisfies product spec\n4. **Review Readiness**: All questions answered before coding\n\n### Phase 3: Validation\n- \u2705 All user stories have acceptance criteria\n- \u2705 All components have data sources defined\n- \u2705 All APIs have schemas documented\n- \u2705 Testing strategy covers all user journeys\n- \u2705 No placeholders or \"TBD\" sections\n- \u2705 Multi-perspective analysis completed (product, engineering, architecture)\n- \u2705 Current industry standards (2025) validation performed\n- \u2705 Critical thinking challenges addressed\n\n## \ud83c\udf93 Lessons from React V2\n\n**What This Prevents**:\n1. **Hardcoded Values**: Data requirements defined upfront\n2. **Missing Features**: Complete feature inventory before coding\n3. **Broken Navigation**: User journeys mapped explicitly\n4. **Placeholder Text**: All UI states documented\n5. **Non-functional Buttons**: Interaction inventory required\n\n**Key Principle**: \"If it's not in the design docs, it's not in the feature\"\n\n## \ud83d\udca1 Usage Examples\n\n### Example 1: Frontend Migration\n```\n/design react-v3-migration\n```\nGenerates:\n- `roadmap/react-v3-migration_product_spec.md`\n- `roadmap/react-v3-migration_eng_design.md`\n-

      "content": "# Plan Command - Execute with Approval\n\n**Purpose**: Same as `/execute` but requires user approval before implementation. **OPTIMIZED FOR MAXIMUM /CEREBRAS CODE GENERATION BATCHING** to leverage 19.6x speed advantage.\n\n**Usage**: `/plan` - Present execution plan with maximum coding work batched for /cerebras\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 MAXIMUM /CEREBRAS BATCHING STRATEGY (PRIMARY FOCUS)\n\n**REVOLUTIONARY SPEED**: /cerebras can generate code up to 19.6x faster (e.g., 500ms vs 10s in example scenarios) \u2013 this is the PRIMARY optimization target. *Note: These metrics are based on internal observations and may vary depending on workload and environment.*\n\n### Batch-First Workflow Philosophy\n**The planning process MUST prioritize identifying and batching ALL possible coding work for /cerebras upfront**:\n\n1. **\ud83d\udccb CODING TASK INVENTORY** (First Step - MANDATORY):\n   - **Scan the entire task** for ANY code generation opportunities\n   - **Group similar coding tasks** that can be generated together\n   - **Identify boilerplate patterns** that /cerebras excels at\n   - **List ALL files/functions/classes** that need creation or major modification\n\n2. **\ud83c\udfaf MAXIMUM BATCH IDENTIFICATION**:\n   - **New file creation** - Perfect for /cerebras with detailed specs\n   - **Function implementations** - Batch multiple functions with clear interfaces\n   - **Test generation** - Batch ALL tests for multiple modules\n   - **Data structures** - Create multiple related classes/interfaces\n   - **Configuration files** - Generate multiple config variations\n   - **Documentation** - Batch documentation for multiple components\n\n3. **\u26a1 BATCH EXECUTION STRATEGY**:\n   - **Front-load ALL /cerebras implementation tasks** ahead of any Claude implementation\n   - Perform only minimal Claude analysis/spec creation required to enable /cerebras batching\n   - **Generate code in logical groups** (all models, all tests, all configs)\n   - **Minimize context switching** between generation and analysis\n   - **Parallel generation** when possible for independent components\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 CRITICAL: SERENA MCP USAGE FOR PR WORK\n\n**MANDATORY for Large PRs (50+ files)**: When working on PR analysis or fixes, ALWAYS use Serena MCP tools as primary approach:\n\n### Serena MCP First Protocol\n1. **\u274c NEVER start by reading entire files** - This wastes context immediately\n2. **\u2705 ALWAYS use Serena semantic tools first**:\n   - `mcp__serena__find_symbol` - Target specific functions/classes\n   - `mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview` - Understand file structure\n   - `mcp__serena__search_for_pattern` - Find code patterns efficiently\n   - `mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols` - Track dependencies\n\n### Example PR Fix Workflow\n```bash\n# \u274c WRONG: Reading entire files\nRead --file_path=\"mvp_site/frontend_v2/src/App.tsx\"  # Wastes 1000+ lines of context!\n\n# \u2705 RIGHT: Targeted Serena analysis\nmcp__serena__search_for_pattern --pattern=\"\\\\(campaign as any\\\\)\" --restrict_search_to_code_files=true\nmcp__serena__find_symbol --name_path=\"handleCampaignCreate\" --include_body=true\n```\n\n### Context Preservation Rules\n- **First 20% of context**: Use Serena for analysis and discovery\n- **Middle 60% of context**: Apply targeted fixes using Edit/MultiEdit\n- **Final 20% of context**: Verification and testing\n- **If context < 30%**: Split task or summarize findings\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 MEMORY INTEGRATION\n\n**Enhanced Planning with Memory MCP**: `/plan` automatically consults Memory MCP before creating execution plans to apply learned patterns, user preferences, and corrections.\n\n### Pre-Planning Memory Query\n- **Automatic Consultation**: Queries learned patterns relevant to the task\n- **Pattern Categorization**: Groups findings by type (corrections, preferences, workflows)\n- **Context Integration**: Applies memory insights to planning decisions\n- **Execution Strategy**: Uses memory patterns to inform parallel vs sequential choices\n\n## \ud83d\udccb GUIDELINES INTEGRATION\n\n**Mistake Prevention System**: `/plan` automatically checks for and applies guidelines from `docs/pr-guidelines/base-guidelines.md` to prevent recurring mistakes.\n\n### Pre-Planning Guidelines Check\n\n**Systematic Mistake Prevention**: This command automatically consults the mistake prevention guidelines system by calling `/guidelines` directly.\n\n**Direct Command Composition**:\n1. **Execute `/guidelines`**: Call the guidelines command for comprehensive consultation\n2. **Guidelines automatically handles**:\n   - Read CLAUDE.md for current rules, constraints, and protocols (MANDATORY)\n   - Read base guidelines from `docs/pr-guidelines/base-guidelines.md`\n   - Detect PR/branch context using GitHub API, branch name patterns, and fallbacks\n   - Create/read specific guidelines:\n     * PR-specific: `docs/pr-guidelines/{PR_NUMBER}/guidelines.md`\n     * Branch-specific: `docs/branch-guidelines/{BRANCH_NAME}/guidelines.md`  \n     * Base-only: `docs/pr-guidelines/base-guidelines.md`\n   - Apply guidelines context to inform planning approach\n3. **Proceed with planning workflow** using guidelines context from `/guidelines` output\n\n**Guidelines Integration**: Direct command composition - `/plan` calls `/guidelines` directly for clean separation of concerns and reliable guidelines consultation.\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 PLAN PROTOCOL\n\n### Phase 1: /CEREBRAS BATCH INVENTORY (PRIMARY STEP - MANDATORY)\n\n**\ud83d\ude80 MAXIMUM CODE GENERATION BATCHING CHECKLIST**:\n```\n## /CEREBRAS BATCHING PROTOCOL -
