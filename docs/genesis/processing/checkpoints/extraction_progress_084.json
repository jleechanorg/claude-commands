The task exceeds 10 delta lines so must use Cerebras API per CLAUDE.md protocol.\n\nPROBLEM ANALYSIS:\n- conftest.py has over-aggressive Flask mocking (lines 198-204) \n- Flask test clients return MagicMock objects instead of real HTTP responses\n- 268 test failures due to assertions like `assert response.status_code == 200` failing because status_code is a MagicMock\n- Need selective mocking: mock external services (Firebase, Gemini) but preserve Flask test infrastructure\n\nSPECIFICATIONS NEEDED:\n\n1. **FLASK TEST CLIENT FIX (conftest.py modification)**\n   - Remove lines 198-204 that over-mock Flask\n   - Keep external service mocking (Firebase, Gemini, requests) \n   - Preserve real Flask.test_client() functionality\n   - Add selective import path mocking that doesn't break Flask testing\n\n2. **TEST FIXTURES HELPER (test_fixtures.py)**\n   - Create reusable Flask app fixture with proper configuration\n   - Authentication bypass fixtures for test headers\n   - Database state management fixtures\n   - Error handling fixtures for consistent test behavior\n\n3. **MOCK HELPERS UTILITY (mock_helpers.py)**\n   - Selective mocking functions that preserve Flask infrastructure\n   - External service mock generators (Firebase responses, Gemini responses)\n   - Helper functions to mock only what's needed without breaking Flask test clients\n   - Mock validation functions to ensure mocks don't interfere with Flask testing\n\n4. **CLIENT FACTORY (client_factory.py)** \n   - Factory pattern for creating configured Flask test clients\n   - Different client configurations for different test scenarios\n   - Authentication state management for test clients\n   - Request/response logging for debugging test issues\n\n5. **TEST DATA GENERATORS (test_data_generators.py)**\n   - Generate realistic campaign data for API tests\n   - Generate user profile data with proper authentication headers\n   - Generate settings data that matches expected API responses\n   - Generate error response data that matches Flask error format\n\n6. **MOCK RESPONSES UTILITY (mock_responses.py)**\n   - Create realistic HTTP response objects that match Flask patterns\n   - Response builders for different HTTP status codes\n   - JSON response formatters that match API specifications\n   - Error response formatters for consistent error handling tests\n\n7. **TEST UTILITIES (test_utilities.py)**\n   - Assert functions for common HTTP response validation\n   - Status code validation helpers\n   - JSON response parsing and validation\n   - Test cleanup utilities\n\nTECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n- All files must maintain existing passing tests (824 tests)\n- Must follow Flask testing best practices\n- Must use proper pytest fixture patterns\n- Must maintain backwards compatibility with existing test files\n- Must not break external service mocking (Firebase, Gemini still need to be mocked)\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT: Generate detailed /cerebras prompt specifications for each of the 7 components above, with exact file paths, import statements, function signatures, and implementation requirements.",
