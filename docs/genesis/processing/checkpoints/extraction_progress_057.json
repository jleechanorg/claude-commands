Focus on:\n1. Verifying all import security patterns are properly implemented\n2. Ensuring subprocess calls follow secure patterns \n3. Any additional code quality improvements needed\n\n**MANDATORY PROTOCOL**:\n1. VERIFY file existence before ANY Edit/MultiEdit usage\n2. MUST run `git diff --stat` before claiming success\n3. PROVIDE specific file paths and line numbers for any changes\n4. DOCUMENT actual modifications made (not claimed modifications)\n\n**Success Criteria**: Actual file changes visible in `git diff` output with proper File Justification Protocol documentation.",

Set convergence goal: \"resolve all serious GitHub comments and make PR mergeable\"\n2. Initialize autonomous loop with GitHub comment resolution focus\n3. Set up success validation criteria\n\n**Phase 2 - Integrated Copilot Processing Loop**:\nFor each convergence iteration:\n1. Auto-execute `/copilot` for direct GitHub comment processing\n2. Use GitHub MCP for fast comment resolution (2-3 minute cycles)\n3. Process all comment types systematically\n4. Validate resolution success after each copilot run\n5. Continue until all serious comments addressed\n\n**Phase 3 - Success Validation**:\n1. Check GitHub PR #1457 status for remaining serious issues\n2. Verify comment thread resolution via GitHub API\n3. Confirm mergeable status\n4. Exit when convergence criteria fully met\n\n**CONTEXT**: \n- Current PR: #1457 https://github.com/jleechanorg/worldarchitect.ai/pull/1457\n- Branch: backup_fix1231\n- Recent work: Backup system TDD implementation and critical issue fixes\n\n**AUTONOMOUS RULES**:\n- FULLY AUTONOMOUS operation until completion or iteration limit\n- No user prompts during execution\n- Evidence-based success confirmation via GitHub API\n- Smart iteration with performance optimization\n\nExecute the complete autonomous copilotc workflow now.",
