For tool invocations, you can ignore the permission handler or run\nccproxy permission-handler in another terminal if you want to test that flow. and generate some logs through claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p and can you do it all autonomously?\n\n\ud83d\udccb Automatically tell the user: \"I detected these commands:/plan /login  and will combine them intelligently.\"</user-prompt-submit-hook>",

These improvements were already implemented in a previous commit:\n\n\ud83d\udd27 Implementation Status\n\u2705 Deterministic Order: sorted(os.listdir(src)) applied for consistent file processing\n\u2705 Script Executability: os.chmod(script_dst, 0o755) with Windows-safe error handling\n\u2705 Cross-Platform Compatibility: Proper exception handling for OSError/NotImplementedError\n\ud83d\udcca Post-Merge Verification\nAfter the major merge from main (52 files, 2011 additions, 5743 deletions):\n\nSyntax Check: \u2705 python -m py_compile passes\nFunctional Test: \u2705 Script executes successfully with sorted output\nCode Quality: \u2705 All robustness improvements intact\nBranch Status: \u2705 export_bug fully synchronized with main\n\ud83c\udfaf Implementation Benefits\nDeterministic Logs: Sorted file processing ensures consistent commit histories\nCross-Platform: Windows-safe chmod with graceful fallback\nReliability: Robust error handling prevents script failures\nThe export system now has enhanced reliability and consistency. Ready for merge! \ud83d\ude80\n\n@coderabbitaicoderabbitai\ncoderabbitai bot commented 2 days ago\nTip\n\nFor best results, initiate chat on the files or code changes.\n\n@jleechan2015 Excellent work! I'm thrilled to hear that the robustness suggestions were already implemented and that they're providing the expected benefits. Your thorough post-merge verification process demonstrates excellent engineering practices:\n\n\u2705 Comprehensive Testing: The syntax checks, functional tests, and cross-platform compatibility validation show solid quality assurance\n\u2705 Deterministic Behavior: The sorted file processing will indeed ensure consistent commit histories\n\u2705 Production Ready: The Windows-safe error handling makes the export system truly cross-platform\n\nYour systematic approach to verification after the major merge (52 files!) shows careful attention to maintaining code quality through significant changes. The export bug fix combined with these robustness improvements creates a solid foundation for the infrastructure script export system.\n\nReady for merge indeed! \ud83d\ude80\n\n  (\\   /)\n ( ._. )\no_(\"_\")(\"_\")\n   ^Happy rabbit celebrating successful implementation!\njleechan2015 and others added 2 commits 2 days ago\n@jleechan2015\nMerge branch 'main' of https://github.com/jleechanorg/worldarchitect.ai\u2026 \n344710a\n@jleechan2015\n@claude\nfix: Address high and medium priority security issues from PR 1606 \n6ea98ff\ncoderabbitai[bot]\ncoderabbitai bot reviewed 26 minutes ago\ncoderabbitai bot left a comment\nActionable comments posted: 2\n\n\u267b\ufe0f Duplicate comments (6)\n\ud83e\uddf9 Nitpick comments (1)\n\ud83d\udcdc Review details\nclaude_mcp.sh\nOutdated\nsetup-github-runner.sh\nOutdated\n@jleechan2015\n@claude\nfix: Address CodeRabbit security and logic improvements \n1c18841\nMerge info\nAll checks have passed\n6 successful checks\n\n\nNo conflicts with base branch\nMerging can be performed automatically.\n\nYou can also merge this with the command line. \n@jleechan2015\n\n\nAdd a comment\nComment\n \nAdd your comment here...\n \nRemember, contributions to this repository should follow our GitHub Community Guidelines.\n ProTip!
