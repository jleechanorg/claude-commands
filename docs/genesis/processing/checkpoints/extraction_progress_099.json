Apply this to: research and then make a design to see if we can heavily use subagents in .claude/agents to save on context. I want almost all operations to be done by subagents, except sequential thinking, and have subagents summarize results in the main convo so we avoid getting full output there. For example lets say we deploy to gcs, most of the output we dont need to see unless something is wrong. subagents should always write output to /tmp/{branch_name}/something_timestamp so we can look at it if we need to\n\n\ud83d\udccb Automatically tell the user: \"I detected these commands:/design /research /arch  and will combine them intelligently.\"</user-prompt-submit-hook>",
