Fix the contradiction by updating both sections to be consistent.\n\n**ISSUE 2 - copilot.md Contradiction**:\nLines 45-46 say \"ALL recent comments focus\" but limit to \"30 recent comments\", contradicting the 100% coverage requirement. Fix by clarifying pagination approach.\n\n**ISSUE 3 - Agent Boundary Logic**:\nAgent description says \"provide explicit responses\" but boundary says \"never handles GitHub comment responses directly\". Fix the logical contradiction.\n\n**FILE JUSTIFICATION PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE**:\n- **Goal**: Fix logical contradictions that undermine command clarity\n- **Modification**: Update inconsistent language in both copilot files\n- **Necessity**: Essential for user understanding and operational consistency\n- **Integration Proof**: These are edits to existing files, no new files created\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n1. Use Edit/MultiEdit tools to fix the contradictions\n2. Maintain the human-first priority approach from the original changes\n3. Keep all existing \"ALL COMMENTS FIRST\" protocol intact\n4. Provide specific line-by-line fixes that resolve the logical inconsistencies\n5. Ensure both files have consistent language about stopping conditions and comment coverage\n\n**EXPECTED OUTPUT**:\n- Actual file changes using Edit/MultiEdit tools\n- Clear resolution of all 3 contradictions\n- Maintained human priority protocol\n- Logical consistency in agent boundaries and workflow descriptions\n\nExecute the fixes systematically and provide evidence of changes made.",
