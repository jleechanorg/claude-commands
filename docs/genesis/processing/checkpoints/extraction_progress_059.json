Here are the specific issues to address:\n\n## Working Directory\nStart in: /Users/jleechan/projects/worldarchitect-memory-backups\n\n## Issues to Fix\n\n### 1. **Refactor chained or expression** in `scripts/merge_memory.py` line 17\n**Issue**: Long chained `or` expression is difficult to read\n**Current code**:\n```python\ncontent = memory.get('content', '') or memory.get('observation', '') or memory.get('text', '') or memory.get('name', '')\n```\n**Fix**: Use iteration for better readability\n\n### 2. **Handle JSON parsing errors** in `scripts/daily_backup.sh`\n**Issue**: Inline Python commands need graceful JSON error handling \n**Location**: Lines around memory.json parsing\n**Problem**: Only catches file errors, not JSON parsing errors\n\n### 3. **Fix duplicate inline Python commands**\n**Issue**: Same JSON parsing code repeated, maintenance burden\n**Fix**: Create reusable function or better error handling\n\n### 4. **Fix change calculation display** in `scripts/daily_backup.sh`  \n**Issue**: Negative changes show as \"+-5\" instead of \"-5\"\n**Fix**: Handle sign conditionally\n\n### 5. **Honor last-write-wins with explicit IDs** in `scripts/merge_memory.py`\n**Issue**: Function should prefer explicit ID fields before content-hash\n**Current**: Always uses content-based ID\n**Fix**: Check for 'id', 'memory_id', 'uuid' fields first, then fall back to content\n\n## Implementation Requirements\n\n- **File Justification Protocol**: Document each file change with Goal, Modification, Necessity, Integration Proof\n- **Security Priority**: Focus on fixing error handling and data integrity issues first  \n- **Pattern Detection**: Apply similar fixes across the codebase\n- **CRDT Compliance**: Ensure changes maintain conflict-free replicated data type behavior\n- **Test Compatibility**: Ensure changes don't break existing test suite\n\n## Expected Deliverables\n\n1. Fixed `scripts/merge_memory.py` with:\n   - Refactored field checking logic\n   - Explicit ID preference in get_memory_id function\n\n2. Fixed `scripts/daily_backup.sh` with:\n   - Robust JSON error handling\n   - Proper change calculation display\n   - Eliminated code duplication\n\n3. **Git diff verification** showing actual file modifications\n4. **File justification** for each change following the protocol\n\nPlease implement these fixes systematically and provide evidence of changes through git diff.",
