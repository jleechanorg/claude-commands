Timestamp comparisons for Last-Write-Wins rely on string comparison of varied formats, which may incorrectly overwrite newer memories. Additionally, a shared fallback counter can cause ID collisions for memories lacking explicit IDs, leading distinct entries to be merged as one.\n\nFix in Cursor Fix in Web\n\n@jleechan2015    Reply...\nMerge info\nAll checks have passed\n1 neutral, 1 successful checks\n\n\nNo conflicts with base branch\nMerging can be performed automatically.\n\nYou can also merge this with the command line. \n@jleechan2015\n\n\nAdd a comment\nComment\n \nAdd your comment here...\n \nRemember, contributions to this repository should follow our GitHub Community Guidelines.\n ProTip!

Use solo developer security focus - real vulnerabilities only.\n\n**Analysis Focus Areas**:\n\n1. **CORRECTNESS ANALYSIS** (Primary Focus):\n   - Import optimization correctness - verify moved imports maintain functionality\n   - Logic integrity - ensure no behavioral changes from import reorganization\n   - Edge case handling - confirm import patterns work across all usage scenarios\n   - Error handling preservation - validate exception handling isn't broken\n\n2. **PRACTICAL SECURITY** (Solo Developer Context - Real Vulnerabilities Only):\n   - Command injection risks in shell scripts\n   - Credential exposure in configuration files \n   - Path traversal in file operations\n   - **FILTER OUT**: JSON schema validation for trusted APIs, theoretical attack vectors, enterprise compliance\n\n3. **PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS**:\n   - Import performance impact (module-level vs inline)\n   - Execution time improvements from eliminating repeated imports\n   - Memory usage patterns\n\n4. **ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS**:\n   - Import organization consistency\n   - Module structure and dependencies\n   - Code organization improvements\n\n**Files to analyze**: scripts/ directory changes, import optimization tools, memory integration fixes\n\n**Output Required**: Technical findings with specific line references, correctness validation, and practical security issues only (no enterprise paranoia). Focus on whether the import optimization maintains correctness while improving performance.\n\n**Context**: This is Track A of parallel analysis for /reviewdeep. Emphasize speed while maintaining thoroughness on correctness and real security concerns.",
