Architectural Correctness\n- Verify the thin proxy pattern is correctly implemented\n- Ensure proxy tools return instructions, not execute logic\n- Validate script execution tools properly call underlying scripts\n- Check MCP protocol compliance\n\n### 2. Code Quality\n- Python best practices and idioms\n- Error handling completeness\n- Security considerations (subprocess execution, input validation)\n- Performance implications\n\n### 3. Tool Implementation\n- Verify all 29 tools are correctly implemented\n- Check tool_definition schemas are complete\n- Validate execute() method signatures\n- Ensure proxy tools don't simulate intelligence\n\n### 4. Integration Points\n- Server initialization and tool registration\n- MCP protocol handling (tools/list, tools/call)\n- Environment variable handling\n- Path resolution for scripts\n\n### 5. Documentation\n- README completeness and accuracy\n- Design document alignment with implementation\n- Code comments where necessary\n\nProvide a detailed review with:\n- Critical issues that must be fixed\n- Improvements for code quality\n- Security recommendations\n- Performance optimizations\n- Documentation gaps",
