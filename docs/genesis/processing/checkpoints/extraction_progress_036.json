      "content": "# /commentfetch Command\n\n**Usage**: `/commentfetch <PR_NUMBER>`\n\n**Purpose**: Fetch UNRESPONDED comments from a GitHub PR including inline code reviews, general comments, review comments, and Copilot suggestions. Also fetches GitHub CI status using /fixpr methodology. Always fetches fresh data from GitHub API - no caching.\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 CRITICAL: Comprehensive Comment Detection Function\n\n**MANDATORY**: Fixed copilot skip detection bug that was ignoring inline review comments:\n```bash\n# \ud83d\udea8 COMPREHENSIVE COMMENT DETECTION FUNCTION \n# CRITICAL FIX: Include ALL comment sources (inline review comments were missing)\nget_comprehensive_comment_count() {\n    local pr_number=$1\n    local owner_repo=$(gh repo view --json owner,name | jq -r '.owner.login + \"/\" + .name')\n    \n    # Get all three comment sources\n    local general_comments=$(gh pr view $pr_number --json comments | jq '.comments | length')\n    local review_comments=$(gh pr view $pr_number --json reviews | jq '.reviews | length')\n    # Robust pagination-safe counting for inline comments\n    local inline_comments=$(gh api \"repos/$owner_repo/pulls/$pr_number/comments\" --paginate --jq '.[].id' 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')\n    inline_comments=${inline_comments:-0}\n    \n    local total=$((general_comments + review_comments + inline_comments))\n    \n    # Silent operation - only output on errors or warnings\n    \n    echo \"$total\"\n}\n```\n\n**Usage**: Call `get_comprehensive_comment_count <PR_NUMBER>` from any command that needs accurate comment counting for skip conditions or processing decisions.\n\n## Description\n\nPure Python implementation that collects UNRESPONDED comments from all GitHub PR sources AND GitHub CI status. Uses GitHub API `in_reply_to_id` field analysis to filter out already-replied comments. Implements /fixpr CI status methodology with defensive programming patterns. Always fetches fresh data on each execution and saves to `/tmp/{branch_name}/comments.json` for downstream processing by `/commentreply`.\n\n## Output Format\n\nSaves structured JSON data to `/tmp/{branch_name}/comments.json` with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"pr\": \"820\",\n  \"fetched_at\": \"2025-01-21T12:00:00Z\",\n  \"comments\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"12345\",\n      \"type\": \"inline|general|review|copilot\",\n      \"body\": \"Comment text\",\n      \"author\": \"username\",\n      \"created_at\": \"2025-01-21T11:00:00Z\",\n      \"file\": \"path/to/file.py\",  // for inline comments\n      \"line\": 42,                  // for inline comments\n      \"already_replied\": false,\n      \"requires_response\": true\n    }\n  ],\n  \"ci_status\": {\n    \"overall_state\": \"FAILING|PASSING|PENDING|ERROR\",\n    \"mergeable\": true,\n    \"merge_state_status\": \"clean\",\n    \"checks\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"test\",\n        \"status\": \"FAILURE\",\n        \"description\": \"Process completed with exit code 1\",\n        \"url\": \"https://github.com/owner/repo/actions/runs/123\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"summary\": {\"total\": 4, \"passing\": 2, \"failing\": 1, \"pending\": 1},\n    \"failing_checks\": [...],\n    \"pending_checks\": [...],\n    \"fetched_at\": \"2025-01-21T12:00:00Z\"\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"total\": 17,\n    \"by_type\": {\n      \"inline\": 8,\n      \"general\": 1,\n      \"review\": 2,\n      \"copilot\": 6\n    },\n    \"unresponded_count\": 8,\n    \"repo\": \"owner/repo\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Comment Types\n\n- **inline**: Code review comments on specific lines\n- **general**: Issue-style comments on the PR\n- **review**: Review summary comments\n- **copilot**: GitHub Copilot suggestions (including suppressed)\n\n## Unresponded Comment Filtering\n\n\ud83d\udea8 **CRITICAL EFFICIENCY ENHANCEMENT**: The command automatically identifies and filters unresponded comments:\n\n### 1. Already-Replied Detection (PRIMARY FILTER)\n- **Method**: Analyze GitHub API `in_reply_to_id` field to identify threaded responses\n- **Logic**: If comment #12345 has any replies with `in_reply_to_id: 12345`, mark as ALREADY_REPLIED\n- **Efficiency**: Skip already-replied comments from downstream processing entirely\n\n### 2. Response Requirement Analysis (SECONDARY FILTER)\nFor comments that are NOT already replied, determine if they need responses based on:\n- Question marks in the comment text\n- Keywords like \"please\", \"could you\", \"fix\", \"issue\", \"suggestion\"\n- Review states (CHANGES_REQUESTED, COMMENTED)\n- Bot comments (Copilot, CodeRabbit) - ALWAYS require responses\n- Human reviewer feedback - ALWAYS require responses\n\n### 3. Output Optimization\n- **JSON field**: `\"already_replied\": false` (only unresponded comments included)\n- **Metadata**: `\"unresponded_count\": X` for quick verification\n- **Fresh Data**: Always fetches current GitHub state, no stale cache issues\n- **Efficiency**: Downstream commands process only comments needing responses\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe command runs the Python script directly:\n```bash\npython3 .claude/commands/_copilot_modules/commentfetch.py <PR_NUMBER>\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n```bash\n# Fetch all fresh comments for PR 820\n/commentfetch 820\n# Internally runs: python3 .claude/commands/_copilot_modules/commentfetch.py 820\n\n# Saves comments to /tmp/{branch_name}/comments.json\n# Downstream commands read from the saved file\n```\n\n## Integration\n\nThis command is typically the first step in the `/copilot` workflow, providing fresh comment data AND CI status to `/tmp/{branch_name}/comments.json` for other commands like `/fixpr` and `/commentreply`. Uses /fixpr methodology for authoritative GitHub CI status with defensive programming patterns. Always fetches current data and overwrites the comments file.\n\n## CI Status Integration\n\n**Enhanced with /fixpr methodology**: \n- Uses `gh pr view --json statusCheckRollup,mergeable,mergeStateStatus` for authoritative GitHub CI data\n- Implements defensive programming patterns (statusCheckRollup is a LIST, safe access)\n- Provides overall state assessment (FAILING/PASSING/PENDING/ERROR)\n- Categorizes checks for quick analysis (failing_checks, pending_checks)\n- Includes merge status and detailed check information\n- Fetched in parallel with comments for optimal performance\n\n\nARGUMENTS: focus last 30 unresponded and see if we truly addressed them",
