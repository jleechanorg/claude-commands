Analyze the current codebase for security, performance, and quality issues\n2. Prioritize improvements based on severity and impact\n3. Execute fixes through the appropriate specialized agents\n4. Ensure all improvements are properly tested and documented\n\nFocus on production-readiness and maintainability. The system is working but needs polish for production deployment.",

Read each file systematically\n2. Identify fake/demo/placeholder patterns\n3. Categorize each issue by severity (Critical/Suspicious/Verification)\n4. Provide file:line references for each issue\n5. Suggest specific fix strategies for each issue\n6. Focus on actual implementation issues, not just style/formatting\n\n**Output Format:**\n```markdown\n# Fake Code Detection - Iteration 1\n\n## Summary\n- Files Analyzed: X/28\n- Total Issues: X\n- Critical Issues: X  \n- Suspicious Patterns: X\n- Verification Needed: X\n\n## Critical Issues (\ud83d\udd34)\n**[file.py:line]** - Brief description\n- Pattern: [what makes this fake]\n- Fix Strategy: [how to fix it]\n\n## Suspicious Patterns (\ud83d\udfe1)\n**[file.py:line]** - Brief description\n- Pattern: [what makes this suspicious]\n- Fix Strategy: [how to improve it]\n\n## Issues by File\n[Detailed breakdown per file]\n```\n\nThis is a systematic fake code audit - be thorough and precise in identifying actual implementation issues vs. legitimate code patterns.",
