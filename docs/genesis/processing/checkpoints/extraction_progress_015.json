      "content": "# Fake3 Command - Branch-Focused Iterative Fake Code Detection and Fixing\n\n**Purpose**: Automate 3 iterations of fake code detection and fixing for all files modified in the current branch with comprehensive tracking, testing, and learning capture\n\n**Usage**: `/fake3` - Runs 3 iterations of fake detection, fixing, testing, and progress tracking **on all branch-modified files**\n\n**Scope**: This command analyzes all files modified in the current branch (including dynamically created files), not just original PR changes\n\n**Type**: Pure LLM-orchestrated command (leverages a Large Language Model to coordinate tasks without external dependencies, no Python dependencies)\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 COMMAND OVERVIEW\n\nThe `/fake3` command orchestrates a complete fake code remediation workflow:\n1. **Detect**: Run `/fake` audit to identify fake/demo/placeholder code\n2. **Fix**: Automatically fix identified issues\n3. **Test**: Verify fixes work correctly\n4. **Track**: Update scratchpad with progress\n5. **Iterate**: Repeat 3 times or until clean\n6. **Learn**: Call `/learn` if any fake code was found\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf WORKFLOW PHASES\n\n### Phase 1: Setup and Initialization\n- Create or update iteration tracking scratchpad\n- Initialize Memory MCP context for fake patterns\n- **Get all branch changes**: `git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD` and `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` (for untracked files)\n- Check current branch status and PR context\n- Prepare fix tracking data structure for all branch-modified files\n\n### Phase 2: Iterative Detection and Fixing (3 iterations max)\nFor each iteration:\n1. **Run Fake Detection** (`/fake` on all branch files)\n   - Execute fake code audit on all branch-modified files (tracked + untracked)\n   - Parse results to identify issues across entire branch changes\n   - Categorize by severity (\ud83d\udd34 Critical, \ud83d\udfe1 Suspicious, \u2705 Verified)\n   - Include dynamically created files from command execution\n\n2. **Apply Fixes**\n   - Remove fake files marked for deletion\n   - Replace placeholder comments with real implementations\n   - Consolidate duplicate implementations\n   - Fix mock/demo functions to real functionality\n   - Verify integration points connect properly\n\n3. **Test Fixes**\n   - Run appropriate test suite for changed files\n   - Verify no new failures introduced\n   - Check integration still works\n   - Document test results\n\n4. **Update Progress**\n   - Write iteration summary to scratchpad\n   - Track: files fixed, issues resolved, tests passed\n   - Note any remaining issues for next iteration\n   - Calculate improvement metrics\n\n5. **Check Completion**\n   - If no fake code found, mark as complete\n   - If 3 iterations done, summarize remaining work\n   - Otherwise, continue to next iteration\n\n### Phase 3: Learning and Finalization\n- If any fake code was found across iterations:\n    - Call `/learn` with summary of patterns found\n    - Store new fake patterns in Memory MCP\n    - Update detection strategies\n- Generate final report with all changes\n- Create comprehensive PR description\n\n## \ud83d\udccb TRACKING FORMAT\n\n### Scratchpad Structure\n```markdown\n# /fake3 Iteration Tracking - [branch_name]\n\n## Overall Progress\n- Start Time: [timestamp]\n- Total Issues Found: [count]\n- Total Issues Fixed: [count]\n- Test Status: [PASS/FAIL]\n\n## Iteration 1\n**Detection Results:**\n- Critical Issues: [count]\n- Suspicious Patterns: [count]\n- Files Analyzed: [count]\n\n**Fixes Applied:**\n- [file:line] -

Search for implementation in similar files\n   - Generate minimal working implementation\n   - Add proper error handling\n\n2. **Mock Functions**\n   - Connect to real services/APIs\n   - Replace hardcoded data with dynamic values\n   - Add configuration for endpoints\n\n3. **Duplicate Implementations**\n   - Identify canonical implementation\n   - Update imports to use shared version\n   - Remove redundant code\n\n4. **Demo Files**\n   - Assess if functionality needed\n   - Either implement properly or remove\n   - Update any references\n\n### Safety Measures\n- LLM creates backup branch before starting using git commands\n- LLM commits after each successful iteration to preserve progress\n- LLM evaluates test failures and stops if issues are catastrophic\n- LLM preserves manual fixes between iterations by reading git history\n- LLM maintains detailed change log in scratchpad for potential rollback\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d EXAMPLE EXECUTION\n\n```console\n/fake3\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Starting /fake3 -

this is a pure LLM command using composition\n\nThis command embodies the principle: \"Automate repetitive quality improvements while learning from each execution through intelligent LLM orchestration.\"\n\n\nARGUMENTS: to make sure you didnt fake these then /reviewdeep then /copilot",

This miscalculates clock skew, causing token compensation to apply when the client is behind instead of ahead. The removal of extreme skew sanity checks further compounds this, potentially leading to authentication failures.\n\nFix in Cursor Fix in Web\n\n@jleechan2015    Reply...\nmvp_site/frontend_v2/src/services/api.service.ts\n      const waitTime = Math.min(this.clockSkewOffset + 500, MAX_COMPENSATION_WAIT_MS);\n    // If we have detected clock skew and client is behind, wait before token generation\n    if (this.clockSkewDetected && this.clockSkewOffset < 0) {\n      const waitTime = Math.abs(this.clockSkewOffset) + 500; // Add 500ms buffer\n@cursor cursor bot 51 minutes ago\nBug: Clock Skew Compensation Logic Reversed\nThe clock skew compensation logic in getCompensatedToken is inverted. It now applies a delay when the client is behind the server (clockSkewOffset < 0), rather than when the client is ahead.

The calculation for estimatedServerTime and clientTimeAtRequest is mathematically incorrect for clock skew detection. Additionally, the token generation compensation now waits when the client is behind instead of ahead, sanity checks for extreme skew values were removed, and getAuthHeaders no longer applies clock skew compensation. These changes can lead to incorrect clock skew measurements and potential Firebase token validation failures.\n\nFix in Cursor Fix in Web\n\n@jleechan2015    Reply...\nmvp_site/frontend_v2/src/services/api.service.ts\n      const waitTime = Math.min(this.clockSkewOffset + 500, MAX_COMPENSATION_WAIT_MS);\n    // If we have detected clock skew and client is behind, wait before token generation\n    if (this.clockSkewDetected && this.clockSkewOffset < 0) {\n      const waitTime = Math.abs(this.clockSkewOffset) + 500; // Add 500ms buffer\n@cursor cursor bot 32 minutes ago\nBug: Clock Skew Logic Inversion Causes Token Errors\nThe clock skew compensation logic in getCompensatedToken is inverted.
