I am an engineering leader with 16+ years of experience who scaled Snap's notification system 100x to send 5 billion daily notifications and architected the YouTube Partner Program which generates billions in annual revenue. I am now focused on using AI to build the next generation of development tools.
AI Engineering Prototypes (2025, Personal R&D)
The future of development will be an act of high-level direction, with autonomous AI agents handling over 90% of the coding, testing, and review. I've built a prototype that proves this is possible.
Created an open-source natural language framework using Claude Code for a team of autonomous AI agents (3-5 coders, 4 reviewers) to collaborate on complex projects.
Maintain an AI venture studio workflow that merged 345 pull requests in 30 days (~11.5/day) across 42 repositories and two GitHub organizations, all coordinated through a personal multi-agent orchestration system.【F:docs/skills/conversation-chronicle.md†L1-L122】【F:docs/skills/conversation-chronicle.md†L123-L175】
Generated over 900 pull requests in one month with a median merge time of 42 minutes and ~70% unit test coverage.
Built a GenAI role-playing game that solved for long-term narrative drift, maintaining a coherent story for over 100 turns.
Professional Experience (2008 - present)
Snap Inc. • Los Angeles, CA • Dec 2018 - Present
Software Engineering Manager
Scaled the notification system 100x, driving company-wide XX% of DAU. When I took over, the system was a monolith that couldn't scale. I led the team that rebuilt it as a microservice architecture (Kubernetes, GCP, AWS), enabling us to grow from 50 million to over 5 billion daily notifications.
Shipped major technical innovations to improve performance and velocity.
To increase the relevance of our notifications, I co-designed a multi-stage machine learning pipeline for candidate scoring and ranking.
To help the team experiment faster, I pitched and launched a system of config-based business rules that allowed for A/B testing without code changes.
Grew my team and expanded my leadership across the organization. I recruited and grew the notifications team from 5 to 12 engineers, mentoring them through promotions. My scope then expanded to include the Profile team, bringing my sub-org to a peak of 24 engineers.
After scaling and handing off the growth notifications product, I now primarily lead the 12-person team focused on Profiles, a core product surface viewed by over 300 million users daily.
YouTube / Google • San Bruno, CA • Oct 2008 - Dec 2018
Staff Software Engineer
Founding Architect of the YouTube Partner Program (2010 - 2013)
I designed and built the systems that created the modern creator economy, scaling it to millions of partners and billions in annual revenue.
Recently, the program has paid out over $70 billion to creators in the last 3 years.
To solve the challenge of scaling a manual approval process, I built a large-scale ML evaluation system that could onboard creators automatically.
To optimize signup velocity, I pitched and launched the use of a shared AdSense account for initial onboarding.
Tech Lead, YouTube Notifications (2014 - 2018)
As Tech Lead, I led the development of core features like the notification bell and inbox, scaling delivery from millions to billions of notifications daily.
My scope of influence included about 20 engineers, and I directly led a team of 10.
