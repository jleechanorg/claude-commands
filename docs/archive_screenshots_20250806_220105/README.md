## Archive Rationale

These screenshots were moved to prepare for fresh evidence collection with:
- Clean directory structure
- Organized evidence folders  
- Clear naming conventions
- Systematic test matrix approach

## Recovery

All archived files remain accessible in this directory. If any archived evidence is needed for reference during fresh testing, it can be:
1. Copied (not moved) to appropriate evidence folders
2. Referenced in comparison analysis
3. Used as baseline for regression testing

## Fresh Testing Location

New evidence collection is organized in:
`/docs/v1_vs_v2_campaign_test_20250806_220105/`
