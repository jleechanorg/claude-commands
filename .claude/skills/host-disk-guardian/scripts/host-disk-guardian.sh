# host-di[REDACTED_OPENAI_KEY] — alert on low HOST free disk, auto-clean at critical threshold
#
# Provenance: 2026-07-03 incident (bead rev-g5bwl) — host disk hit 100% (285MB
# free/926GB) mid runner-fleet recovery, corrupting colima's containerd content
# store (blob I/O errors) and nearly re-crashing the fleet. mac-runner-di[REDACTED_OPENAI_KEY]
# (retired along with self-hosted-oss) only ever watched CONTAINER overlay space,
# never true HOST free space — this script closes that specific gap.
#
# This is deliberately independent of ezgha's own disk floor check
# (src/docker_backend.rs, min_free_disk_gb): that check measures disk "as seen
# by the docker daemon" and gates NEW container spawns. It does not see or
# clean host-side, non-docker files (evidence bundles, scratchpads, stray
# worktrees) — the actual root cause of the 2026-07-03 incident.
#
# Usage:
#   bash host-di[REDACTED_OPENAI_KEY]                  # check + clean if critical
#   bash host-di[REDACTED_OPENAI_KEY] --dry-run         # report only, never delete
#   bash host-di[REDACTED_OPENAI_KEY] --check-only      # alias for --dry-run
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = free space at or above WARN_THRESHOLD_GB (healthy)
#   1 = free space below WARN_THRESHOLD_GB (alert logged)
#   2 = free space below CRITICAL_THRESHOLD_GB (auto-clean ran)
#
# Logs to: /tmp/host-di[REDACTED_OPENAI_KEY]

# Worktree cleanup is the highest-risk target (deletes a git working tree),
# so it gets four independent safety gates before anything is removed:
#   1. The worktree's own `origin` remote must actually be
#      $GITHUB_REPOSITORY -- a same-named branch in an unrelated
#      repo checkout under the glob must never be trusted by branch-name
#      lookup alone (bead rev-9qxkm).
#   2. The worktree's branch must have an associated PR that is CONFIRMED
#      merged, AND the worktree's current HEAD SHA must match that PR's
#      headRefOid exactly -- a reused/rebased branch name is not proof the
#      checked-out commit was ever part of the merged PR.
#   3. The worktree must have zero uncommitted changes (git status --porcelain
#      empty) -- never discard in-progress work, merged PR or not.
#   4. `git worktree remove` is called WITHOUT --force, so git's own
#      "worktree has changes" refusal is the REAL backstop even if gate 3
#      somehow missed something (a TOCTOU race between the status check and
#      this call, for example). --force previously bypassed this refusal
#      entirely, which defeated the backstop this comment claimed existed
#      (bead rev-9qxkm) -- if git refuses, log and skip, never escalate to a
#      raw rm -rf.
