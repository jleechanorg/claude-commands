# Code Centralization - Avoiding Duplication

**Purpose**: Guidelines for identifying, extracting, and centralizing duplicated code to create single sources of truth and improve maintainability.

## Core Principle

**Duplication is a maintenance liability.** When the same logic exists in multiple places, changes must be made in multiple locations, increasing the risk of inconsistencies and bugs.

## When to Centralize

### Red Flags: Code That Should Be Centralized

1. **Identical Logic in Multiple Files**
   - Same `hasattr()` checks repeated
   - Same fallback logic duplicated
   - Same validation patterns copied

2. **Similar Patterns with Minor Variations**
   - Type coercion logic repeated with slight differences
   - Property accessors with same fallback chains
   - API response building with duplicated field handling

3. **Maintenance Burden**
   - Bug fixes require changes in multiple places
   - Feature additions need updates across files
   - Tests must cover the same logic multiple times

### Example: action_resolution/outcome_resolution Duplication

**Before (Duplicated Logic)**:

```python
# ❌ BAD - llm_response.py (22 lines)
@property
def action_resolution(self) -> dict[str, Any]:
    if self.structured_response:
        if hasattr(self.structured_response, "action_resolution"):
            ar = self.structured_response.action_resolution
            if ar is not None:
                return ar
        if hasattr(self.structured_response, "outcome_resolution"):
            or_val = self.structured_response.outcome_resolution
            if or_val is not None:
                return or_val
    return {}

# ❌ BAD - world_logic.py (13 lines) - Same logic duplicated
if hasattr(structured_response, "action_resolution"):
    action_resolution = getattr(structured_response, "action_resolution", None)
    if action_resolution is not None:
        unified_response["action_resolution"] = (
            action_resolution if isinstance(action_resolution, dict) else {}
        )
if hasattr(structured_response, "outcome_resolution"):
    outcome_resolution = getattr(structured_response, "outcome_resolution", None)
    if outcome_resolution is not None:
        unified_response["outcome_resolution"] = (
            outcome_resolution if isinstance(outcome_resolution, dict) else {}
        )
```

**After (Centralized)**:

```python
# ✅ GOOD - action_resolution_utils.py (single source of truth)
def get_action_resolution(structured_response: Any) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Get action_resolution with backward compat fallback."""
    if structured_response is None:
        return {}
    if hasattr(structured_response, "action_resolution"):
        ar = structured_response.action_resolution
        if ar is not None:
            return ar
    if hasattr(structured_response, "outcome_resolution"):
        or_val = structured_response.outcome_resolution
        if or_val is not None:
            return or_val
    return {}

def add_action_resolution_to_response(structured_response: Any, unified_response: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
    """Add action_resolution/outcome_resolution to API response."""
    if structured_response is None:
        return
    if hasattr(structured_response, "action_resolution"):
        ar = getattr(structured_response, "action_resolution", None)
        if ar is not None:
            unified_response["action_resolution"] = (
                ar if isinstance(ar, dict) else {}
            )
    if hasattr(structured_response, "outcome_resolution"):
        or_val = getattr(structured_response, "outcome_resolution", None)
        if or_val is not None:
            unified_response["outcome_resolution"] = (
                or_val if isinstance(or_val, dict) else {}
            )

# ✅ GOOD - llm_response.py (2 lines)
@property
def action_resolution(self) -> dict[str, Any]:
    return get_action_resolution(self.structured_response)

# ✅ GOOD - world_logic.py (1 line)
add_action_resolution_to_response(structured_response, unified_response)
```

**Results**:
- **Before**: 35 lines of duplicated logic across 2 files
- **After**: 20 lines in helper module + 3 lines total in consuming files
- **Net reduction**: 12 lines + single source of truth

## TDD Approach to Centralization

### Step 1: Write Tests First (RED)

Before extracting code, write comprehensive tests for the helper functions:

```python
# ✅ GOOD - Test all edge cases before extraction
def test_get_action_resolution_with_action_resolution(self):
    """Test returns action_resolution when present"""
    mock_response = MagicMock()
    mock_response.action_resolution = {"player_input": "I attack"}
    result = get_action_resolution(mock_response)
    self.assertEqual(result["player_input"], "I attack")

def test_get_action_resolution_falls_back_to_outcome_resolution(self):
    """Test falls back to outcome_resolution when action_resolution missing"""
    # ... test implementation

def test_get_action_resolution_handles_none(self):
    """Test handles None structured_response"""
    result = get_action_resolution(None)
    self.assertEqual(result, {})

# ... 15+ more edge case tests
```

### Step 2: Extract Helper Functions (GREEN)

Create helper module with functions that make tests pass:

```python
# ✅ GOOD - Helper module with clear responsibilities
# $PROJECT_ROOT/action_resolution_utils.py

def get_action_resolution(structured_response: Any) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Single source of truth for fallback logic."""
    # Implementation that passes all tests

def add_action_resolution_to_response(structured_response: Any, unified_response: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
    """API response builder with type coercion."""
    # Implementation that passes all tests
```

### Step 3: Refactor Existing Code (REFACTOR)

Replace duplicated logic with helper calls:

```python
# ✅ GOOD - Replace 22 lines with 1 function call
@property
def action_resolution(self) -> dict[str, Any]:
    return get_action_resolution(self.structured_response)
```

### Step 4: Verify No Regressions

Run all existing tests to ensure behavior unchanged:

```bash
# ✅ GOOD - Verify backward compatibility
pytest $PROJECT_ROOT/tests/test_action_resolution.py
pytest $PROJECT_ROOT/tests/test_end2end/test_action_resolution_backward_compat_end2end.py
pytest $PROJECT_ROOT/tests/test_action_resolution_utils.py  # New helper tests
```

## Helper Module Design Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility

Each helper function should do one thing well:

```python
# ✅ GOOD - Clear, focused function
def get_action_resolution(structured_response: Any) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Get action_resolution with backward compat fallback."""
    # Only handles retrieval logic

# ❌ BAD - Does too much
def process_action_resolution(structured_response: Any, validate: bool, coerce: bool) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Gets, validates, and coerces action_resolution."""
    # Mixes retrieval, validation, and coercion
```

### 2. Backward Compatibility

Helper functions must maintain exact same behavior:

```python
# ✅ GOOD - Preserves empty dict {} as "present" (not None)
if ar is not None:  # Empty dict {} passes this check
    return ar

# ❌ BAD - Would break existing behavior
if ar:  # Empty dict {} fails this check
    return ar
```

### 3. Type Safety

Handle None and invalid types gracefully:

```python
# ✅ GOOD - Defensive None checks
if structured_response is None:
    return {}

# ✅ GOOD - Type coercion for API responses
unified_response["action_resolution"] = (
    action_resolution if isinstance(action_resolution, dict) else {}
)
```

### 4. Clear Naming

Function names should clearly indicate purpose:

```python
# ✅ GOOD - Self-documenting names
get_action_resolution()  # Retrieves with fallback
add_action_resolution_to_response()  # Adds to API response

# ❌ BAD - Ambiguous names
process_resolution()  # What does it do?
handle_action()  # Too generic
```

## When NOT to Centralize

### Keep Separate If:

1. **Different Purposes**
   - Initialization-time validation vs runtime property access
   - Schema normalization vs API response building
   - Different contexts require different logic

2. **Performance Critical**
   - Inline logic avoids function call overhead
   - Hot paths where microseconds matter
   - (Rare - usually premature optimization)

3. **Tight Coupling**
   - Logic is tightly coupled to specific class internals
   - Extraction would require exposing private state
   - Helper would need too many parameters

**Example**: `narrative_response_schema.py` initialization logic stays separate because it handles validation/normalization at object creation time, which is different from runtime property access.

## Test Coverage Requirements

### Before Refactoring

Ensure existing tests provide safety net:

- ✅ Unit tests for schema layer
- ✅ End-to-end tests for integration paths
- ✅ Edge case coverage (None, empty dict, type coercion)

### After Extraction

Add comprehensive tests for helpers:

- ✅ Unit tests for each helper function
- ✅ Edge cases (None, empty dict, invalid types)
- ✅ Backward compatibility verification
- ✅ Integration tests with refactored code

**Minimum**: 15-20 test cases per helper function to cover all edge cases.

## Code Reduction Metrics

Track improvements:

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Lines of duplicated logic | 35 | 0 | -35 lines |
| Helper module lines | 0 | 20 | +20 lines |
| Consuming code lines | 35 | 3 | -32 lines |
| **Net change** | 35 | 23 | **-12 lines** |
| **Test coverage** | 19 tests | 37 tests | **+18 tests** |

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Premature Centralization

Don't extract code that's only used once:

```python
# ❌ BAD - Over-engineering for single use
def get_single_use_helper():
    """Only called once - not worth extracting"""
    pass
```

### ❌ Over-Abstracting

Don't create helpers that are harder to use than inline code:

```python
# ❌ BAD - More complex than original
def process_with_fallback(obj, primary_field, fallback_field, default_value, type_check, coerce_func):
    """Too many parameters - harder to use than inline"""
    pass

# ✅ GOOD - Simple, focused helper
def get_action_resolution(structured_response: Any) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Clear purpose, minimal parameters"""
    pass
```

### ❌ Breaking Backward Compatibility

Don't change behavior when centralizing:

```python
# ❌ BAD - Changed behavior (empty dict now returns fallback)
if ar:  # Changed from "if ar is not None"
    return ar

# ✅ GOOD - Preserves exact behavior
if ar is not None:  # Same as original
    return ar
```

## Checklist for Centralization

Before extracting duplicated code:

- [ ] Identified 2+ locations with similar logic
- [ ] Written comprehensive tests for helper functions (TDD)
- [ ] Verified existing tests provide safety net
- [ ] Extracted helper functions that pass all tests
- [ ] Refactored consuming code to use helpers
- [ ] All existing tests still pass (no regressions)
- [ ] Helper functions have 15+ test cases covering edge cases
- [ ] Code reduction achieved (net lines saved)
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

## Related Patterns

- **DRY Principle**: Don't Repeat Yourself
- **Single Source of Truth**: One place for each piece of logic
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before refactoring
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain exact same behavior

## Real-World Example

See `$PROJECT_ROOT/action_resolution_utils.py` for a complete example:
- Helper functions with comprehensive tests
- Refactored `llm_response.py` and `world_logic.py`
- 37 tests passing (18 new + 19 existing)
- 20 lines saved + eliminated duplication
