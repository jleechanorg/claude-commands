## ðŸ“‹ REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION

# Fake Code Detection Command - /fakel (Light)

**Purpose**: Quick fake code detection - exactly the same as `/fake` but with faster analysis

**Usage**: `/fakel` - Memory-enhanced light audit for non-functional code patterns

## ðŸš¨ COMMAND COMPOSITION

This command combines: `/arch /think /devilsadvocate /diligent`

**Key Difference**: Uses `/think` (4 thoughts) instead of `/thinku` (10+ thoughts) for faster analysis.

## ðŸ“‹ COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION

For full documentation on detection patterns, execution protocol, reporting format, and all other details, see the `/fake` command documentation in `fake.md`.

The `/fakel` command uses **identical functionality** with the only difference being the thinking depth:
- `/fake`: Deep analysis (10+ thoughts)
- `/fakel`: Light analysis (4 thoughts)

All detection targets, Memory MCP integration, success criteria, and remediation guidance are the same.
