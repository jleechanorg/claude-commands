# PR Command - Complete Development Lifecycle

**Purpose**: Complete development lifecycle from thinking through to PR review

**Usage**: `/pr` - Think, execute, push, review, and handle feedback

## 🚨 COMPLETE PR WORKFLOW

This command conceptually combines the functionality of: `/think /execute /push /review /copilot`

### Phase 1: Think (/think)

**Strategic thinking about the task**:
- Analyze the problem deeply
- Consider multiple approaches
- Identify potential challenges
- Plan implementation strategy

### Phase 2: Execute (/execute)

**Implement the solution**:
- Use realistic execution protocol
- Consider subagents for parallel work
- Work through implementation systematically
- Test and validate as we go

### Phase 3: Push (/push)

**Create PR with comprehensive details**:
- Commit all changes
- Push to remote branch
- Create detailed PR description
- Include test results and screenshots

### Phase 4: Review (/review)

**Comprehensive code review**:
- Analyze code quality
- Check for potential issues
- Verify test coverage
- Document any concerns

### Phase 5: Copilot (/copilot)

**Address automated feedback**:
- Handle GitHub bot comments
- Fix failing tests
- Address security/performance suggestions
- Make PR mergeable

## Command Combination

**The `/pr` command works with the universal command composition system**:
- Uses meta-prompt approach to combine all five commands
- Leverages Claude's natural language processing
- Maintains context across all phases
- Provides comprehensive development experience

## Example Flow

**`/pr` Flow**:
```
User: /pr implement user login validation
Assistant: I detected these commands: /think /execute /push /review /copilot and will combine them intelligently.

Phase 1 - Think:
[Deep analysis of login validation requirements]

Phase 2 - Execute:
[Implementation with optional subagents]

Phase 3 - Push:
[Create PR with comprehensive description]

Phase 4 - Review:
[Comprehensive code review]

Phase 5 - Copilot:
[Address automated feedback and make PR mergeable]
```
