# /copilot - Fast Direct Orchestrated PR Processing

## üö® Mandatory Comment Coverage Tracking
This command automatically tracks comment coverage and warns about missing responses:
```bash
# COVERAGE TRACKING: Monitor comment response completion (silent unless errors)
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Automatic Timing Protocol
This command silently tracks execution time and only reports if exceeded:
```bash
# Silent timing - only output if >3 minutes
COPILOT_START_TIME=$(date +%s)
# ... execution phases ...
COPILOT_END_TIME=$(date +%s)
COPILOT_DURATION=$((COPILOT_END_TIME - COPILOT_START_TIME))
if [ $COPILOT_DURATION -gt 180 ]; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Performance exceeded: $((COPILOT_DURATION / 60))m $((COPILOT_DURATION % 60))s (target: 3m)"
fi
```

## üéØ Purpose
Ultra-fast PR processing using direct GitHub MCP tools instead of Task delegation. Optimized for 2-3 minute execution vs 20+ minute agent overhead.

## ‚ö° **PERFORMANCE ARCHITECTURE: Direct Orchestration**
- **No Task delegation** - Orchestrate all workflow phases directly within the copilot context (no external agents)
- **Direct GitHub MCP tools** - Use GitHub MCP tools directly in each phase
- **30 recent comments focus** - Process only actionable recent feedback
- **Expected time**: **2-3 minutes** (vs 20+ minutes with Task overhead)

## üöÄ Core Workflow - Subcommand Orchestration

**IMPLEMENTATION**: Use existing subcommands systematically until GitHub is completely clean

**INITIAL STATUS & TIMING SETUP**: Get comprehensive status and initialize timing
```bash
# Get comprehensive PR status first
/gstatus

# Record start time for performance tracking
COPILOT_START_TIME=$(date +%s)
```

### Phase 1: Assessment & Planning
**Command**: `/execute` - Plan the PR processing work with TodoWrite tracking
- Analyze current PR state and comment volume
- Create systematic processing plan with TodoWrite
- Set up progress tracking for all phases
- Evaluate skip conditions based on PR state

### Phase 2: Comment Collection
**Command**: `/commentfetch` - Get all PR comments and issues
- Fetches recent comments requiring responses
- Identifies critical issues, security problems, merge conflicts
- Creates clean JSON dataset for systematic processing

### Phase 3: Issue Resolution with File Justification Protocol
**Command**: `/fixpr` - Fix all identified problems systematically using ACTUAL CODE IMPLEMENTATION

**üö® MANDATORY FILE JUSTIFICATION PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE**:
- **Every file modification** must follow FILE JUSTIFICATION PROTOCOL before implementation
- **Required documentation**: Goal, Modification, Necessity, Integration Proof for each change
- **Integration verification**: Proof that adding to existing files was attempted first
- **Protocol adherence**: All changes must follow NEW FILE CREATION PROTOCOL hierarchy
- **Justification categories**: Classify each change as Essential, Enhancement, or Unnecessary

**Implementation with Protocol Enforcement**:
- **Priority Order**: Security ‚Üí Runtime Errors ‚Üí Test Failures ‚Üí Style  
- **MANDATORY TOOLS**: Edit/MultiEdit for code changes, NOT GitHub review posting
- **IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT**: Must modify actual files to resolve issues WITH justification
- **VERIFICATION**: Use git diff to confirm file changes made AND protocol compliance
- **Protocol validation**: Each file change must be justified before Edit/MultiEdit usage
- Resolve merge conflicts and dependency issues (with integration evidence)
- Fix failing tests and CI pipeline problems (with necessity proof)
- **Continue until**: All technical issues resolved with verified code changes AND justified modifications
- **ANTI-PATTERN**: Posting GitHub reviews acknowledging issues ‚â† fixing issues
- **PROTOCOL VIOLATION**: Making file changes without FILE JUSTIFICATION PROTOCOL compliance

### Phase 3.1: Implementation Tool Requirements (MANDATORY)
**IMPLEMENTATION TOOLS** (in priority order):
1. **Edit/MultiEdit tools** - For code changes, bug fixes, implementation
2. **GitHub MCP tools** - ONLY for communication, NOT for implementation
3. **Bash commands** - For file operations, testing, validation

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION**:
- ‚ùå **PERFORMATIVE**: `github_create_review("Fixed import issue")` 
- ‚úÖ **ACTUAL**: `Edit(old_string="import module", new_string="from package import module")`

### Phase 4: Response Generation
**Command**: `/commentreply` - Reply to all review comments
- Post technical responses to reviewer feedback
- Address bot suggestions with implementation details
- Use proper GitHub threading for line-specific comments
- **Continue until**: All comments have appropriate responses

### Phase 5: Coverage & Implementation Verification (MANDATORY)
**Command**: `/commentcheck` - Verify 100% comment coverage AND actual implementation
- **DUAL VERIFICATION REQUIRED**:
  1. **Communication Coverage**: All comments have threaded responses
  2. **Implementation Coverage**: All fixable issues have actual code changes
- **IMPLEMENTATION VERIFICATION**: Use `git diff` to confirm file modifications
- Validates response quality (not generic templates)
- Detects any missed or unaddressed feedback
- **üö® CRITICAL**: Issues explicit warnings for unresponded comments
- **FAILURE CONDITIONS**: 
  - ‚ùå Comments acknowledged but not fixed = FAILURE
  - ‚ùå GitHub reviews posted without code changes = FAILURE
  - ‚úÖ Comments responded to AND issues implemented = SUCCESS
- **Must pass**: Zero unresponded comments before proceeding
- **AUTO-FIX**: If coverage < 100%, automatically runs `/commentreply` again

### Phase 6: Verification & Iteration  
**Iterative Cycle**: Repeat `/commentfetch` ‚Üí `/fixpr` ‚Üí `/commentreply` ‚Üí `/commentcheck` cycle until completion
- **Keep going until**: No new comments, all tests pass, CI green, 100% coverage
- **GitHub State**: Clean PR with no unresolved feedback
- **Merge Ready**: No conflicts, no failing tests, all discussions resolved
- **Note**: This is an iterative loop, not a single linear execution

### Phase 7: Final Push
**Command**: `/pushl` - Push all changes with labels and description
- Commit all fixes and responses
- Update PR description with complete change summary
- Apply appropriate labels based on changes made

### Phase 8: Coverage & Timing Report
**MANDATORY COVERAGE + TIMING COMPLETION**: Calculate and display execution performance with coverage warnings
```bash
# COVERAGE VERIFICATION - MANDATORY
# Get current comment statistics
TOTAL_COMMENTS=$(gh api "repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR/comments" --paginate | jq length)
THREADED_REPLIES=$(gh api "repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR/comments" --paginate | jq '[.[] | select(.in_reply_to_id != null)] | length')
ORIGINAL_COMMENTS=$(gh api "repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR/comments" --paginate | jq '[.[] | select(.in_reply_to_id == null)] | length')

# Calculate coverage percentage
if [ "$ORIGINAL_COMMENTS" -gt 0 ]; then
    COVERAGE_PERCENT=$(( (THREADED_REPLIES * 100) / ORIGINAL_COMMENTS ))
    
    # MANDATORY WARNING SYSTEM - only output if incomplete
    if [ "$COVERAGE_PERCENT" -lt 100 ]; then
        MISSING_REPLIES=$((ORIGINAL_COMMENTS - THREADED_REPLIES))
        echo "üö® WARNING: INCOMPLETE COMMENT COVERAGE DETECTED!"
        echo "‚ùå Missing replies: $MISSING_REPLIES comments"
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Coverage: $COVERAGE_PERCENT% ($THREADED_REPLIES/$ORIGINAL_COMMENTS)"
        echo "üîß REQUIRED ACTION: Run /commentreply to address missing responses"
    fi
fi

# Calculate execution time - only report if over target
COPILOT_END_TIME=$(date +%s)
COPILOT_DURATION=$((COPILOT_END_TIME - COPILOT_START_TIME))
if [ $COPILOT_DURATION -gt 180 ]; then
    COPILOT_MINUTES=$((COPILOT_DURATION / 60))
    COPILOT_SECONDS=$((COPILOT_DURATION % 60))
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è PERFORMANCE: Duration ${COPILOT_MINUTES}m ${COPILOT_SECONDS}s exceeded 3m target"
fi
```

### Phase 9: Guidelines Integration & Learning
**Command**: `/guidelines` - Post-execution guidelines consultation and pattern capture
- **Universal Composition**: Call `/guidelines` at completion for systematic learning
- **Pattern Capture**: Document successful approaches and anti-patterns discovered
- **Mistake Prevention**: Update PR-specific guidelines with lessons learned
- **Continuous Improvement**: Enhance guidelines system with execution insights
- **Integration**: Seamless handoff using command composition for systematic learning

```bash
# PHASE 9: POST-EXECUTION GUIDELINES INTEGRATION
# Execute and capture output + status
GUIDE_OUTPUT=$(/guidelines 2>&1)
GUIDE_STATUS=$?

# Surface output for transparency
printf "%s\n" "$GUIDE_OUTPUT"

if [ "$GUIDE_STATUS" -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "‚ùå /guidelines failed (exit $GUIDE_STATUS)" >&2
  return 1 2>/dev/null || exit 1
fi
```

## üß† Decision Logic

### When to Use /copilot
- **High comment volume** (10+ comments requiring technical responses)
- **Complex PR reviews** with multiple reviewers and feedback types
- **Critical security issues** requiring systematic resolution
- **CI failures** combined with code review feedback
- **Time-sensitive PRs** needing rapid but thorough processing

### Autonomous Operation Mode
- **Continues through conflicts** - doesn't stop for user approval on fixes
- **Applies systematic resolution** - follows security ‚Üí runtime ‚Üí style priority
- **Maintains full transparency** - all actions visible in command execution
- **Preserves user control** - merge operations still require explicit approval

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

### Recent Comments Focus (Default Behavior)
- **Default Processing**: Last 30 comments chronologically (90%+ faster)
- **Rationale**: Recent comments contain 80% of actionable feedback
- **Performance Impact**: ~20-30 minutes ‚Üí ~3-5 minutes processing time
- **Context Efficiency**: 90%+ reduction in token usage

### When to Use Full Processing
- **Security Reviews**: Process all comments for comprehensive security analysis
- **Major PRs**: Full processing for critical architectural changes  
- **Compliance**: Complete audit trail requirements
- **Implementation**: Use full comment processing instead of recent 30 focus

### Performance Comparison
| Scenario | Comments | Processing Time | Context Usage |
|----------|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Default (Recent 30)** | 30 | ~3-5 minutes | Low |
| **Full Processing** | 300+ | ~20-30 minutes | Very High |
| **Performance Gain** | 90% fewer | 80%+ faster | 90%+ efficient |

## üîß Error Handling & Recovery

### Common Scenarios
**Merge Conflicts:**
- Automatic conflict detection and resolution
- Backup creation before conflict fixes
- Validation of resolution correctness

**CI Failures:**
- Test failure analysis and systematic fixes
- Dependency issues and import errors
- Build configuration problems

**Comment Threading Issues:**
- Fallback to general comments if threading fails
- Retry mechanism for API rate limits
- Error logging for debugging

### Recovery Patterns
```bash
# If /commentfetch fails
- Check GitHub API connectivity
- Verify repository access permissions
- Retry with exponential backoff

# If /fixpr gets stuck
- Review error logs for specific issues
- Apply manual fixes for complex conflicts
- Continue with remaining automated fixes

# If /commentreply fails
- Check comment posting permissions
- Verify threading API parameters
- Fall back to non-threaded comments
```

## üìä Success Criteria

### üö® CRITICAL: Comment Coverage Requirements (ZERO TOLERANCE)
- ‚úÖ **100% Comment Coverage**: Every original comment MUST have a threaded reply
- üö® **Coverage Warnings**: Automatic alerts when coverage < 100%
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Missing Response Detection**: Explicit identification of unresponded comments
- üîß **Auto-Fix Trigger**: Automatically runs `/commentreply` if gaps detected
- üìä **Coverage Metrics**: Real-time tracking of responses vs originals ratio
- ‚ùå **FAILURE STATE**: < 100% coverage triggers warnings and corrective action

### üö® IMPLEMENTATION SUCCESS CRITERIA (ZERO TOLERANCE)
- ‚úÖ **Code Changes Made**: `git diff` shows actual file modifications for reported issues
- ‚úÖ **Implementation Verification**: Fixed code can be demonstrated with specific file references
- ‚ùå **FAILURE STATE**: GitHub reviews acknowledging issues without implementing fixes
- üîß **ANTI-PATTERN DETECTION**: Any issue marked "fixed" must have corresponding file changes

### Completion Indicators
- ‚úÖ All critical comments addressed with technical responses
- ‚úÖ All security vulnerabilities resolved
- ‚úÖ All test failures fixed 
- ‚úÖ All merge conflicts resolved
- ‚úÖ CI passing (green checkmarks)
- ‚úÖ No unaddressed reviewer feedback
- ‚úÖ **GitHub State**: Clean PR ready for merge
- ‚úÖ **Iteration Complete**: `/commentfetch` shows no new actionable issues
- ‚úÖ **Comment Coverage**: 100% response rate verified with warnings system

### Quality Gates
- **Technical Accuracy**: Responses demonstrate actual understanding
- **Complete Coverage**: No comments left without appropriate response
- **Real Implementation**: All fixes are functional, not placeholder
- **Proper Threading**: Comments use GitHub's threading API correctly
- **Coverage Tracking**: Continuous monitoring with explicit warnings
