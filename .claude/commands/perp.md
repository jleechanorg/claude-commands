## ‚ö° EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE
**When this command is invoked, YOU (Claude) must execute these steps immediately:**
**This is NOT documentation - these are COMMANDS to execute right now.**
**Use TodoWrite to track progress through multi-phase workflows.**

## üö® EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Execute Documented Workflow

**Action Steps:**
1. Review the reference documentation below and execute the detailed steps sequentially.

## üìã REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION

# Perp Command - Comprehensive Multi-Search

**Purpose**: Combine multiple search engines for comprehensive results

**Usage**: `/perp <query>` - Search across Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, and Grok simultaneously (with Grok prioritized when available for its real-time signal)

## üîç MULTI-ENGINE SEARCH PROTOCOL

### Current Date Awareness (macOS + Ubuntu)

Always establish today's date before running any searches so results can be evaluated for freshness:

```sh
CURRENT_DATE=$(date "+%Y-%m-%d")
```

This command is portable across macOS and Ubuntu shells.

If `date` is unexpectedly unavailable, run the following Python fallback command:

```python
python3 -c "from datetime import datetime; print(datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))"
```

Use `CURRENT_DATE` when crafting queries (e.g., adding `2025` or "as of $CURRENT_DATE") and call out any sources that predate today to prevent stale guidance.

This command provides comprehensive multi-engine search by intelligently using whatever search tools are available:
1. **Claude Default Search** (WebSearch) - Claude's built-in web search
2. **Perplexity MCP** - AI-powered search with conversation capabilities
3. **Gemini MCP** - AI development consultation and code assistance
4. **Grok MCP** - Real-time intelligence and trending analysis from X.ai (always include when available)

### Search Engine Details

#### 1. Claude WebSearch

**Capabilities**:
- Up-to-date web information
- Search result blocks with summaries
- Domain filtering (include/exclude)
- US-based search results

#### 2. Perplexity MCP

**Capabilities**:
- AI-powered conversational search
- Real-time information synthesis
- Context-aware responses
- Academic and research focus

#### 3. Gemini MCP

**Capabilities**:
- AI development consultation and code assistance
- Technical problem-solving perspective
- Alternative AI analysis approach
- Development-focused insights

#### 4. Grok MCP

**Capabilities**:
- Real-time intelligence sourced from X (Twitter) data streams
- Broad general-knowledge assistant for timely events and trends
- Conversational responses that complement search summaries
- Supports both chat and function-calling style tool use
- Recommended as the first-pass signal when time-sensitive context matters

## Search Combination Strategy

**Intelligent Execution**:
- Try all available search engines automatically
- Prioritize Grok's real-time signal when time-sensitive insight is needed
- Handle any unavailable services gracefully
- Results are compared and synthesized
- Unique insights from each working engine are highlighted
- Comprehensive answer combines all available sources

**Result Synthesis**:
- Extract key information from each source
- Identify overlapping vs. unique findings
- Highlight conflicting information
- Provide source attribution for all claims

## Example Usage

**Query**: `/perp figure out how to talk to anthropic api with python`

**Expected Flow**:
```
üîç Searching across multiple engines for: "figure out how to talk to anthropic api with python"

üìä Claude WebSearch Results:
[Latest Anthropic API documentation and tutorials]

üß† Perplexity Analysis:
[AI-synthesized answer with current best practices]

üíé Gemini Consultation:
[Development-focused technical analysis and code guidance]

üöÄ Grok Intelligence:
[Real-time trends, X-sourced context, and conversational synthesis]

üéØ Synthesized Answer:
[Combined insights from all four sources with attribution]
```

## Protocol Implementation

**Multi-Search Execution**:
1. Parse user query from `/perp` command
2. Determine available MCP tools (`/tools list` or local registry) and skip any engines that are not installed.
3. Execute all available searches in parallel:
   - `WebSearch(query=user_query)`
   - `mcp__perplexity-ask__perplexity_ask(messages=[{role: "user", content: user_query}])`
   - Gemini MCP with fallback:
     - Try `mcp__gemini-cli-mcp__gemini_chat_pro(message=user_query)`
     - If quota exceeded, fallback to `mcp__gemini-cli-mcp__gemini_chat_flash(message=user_query)`
   - Grok MCP chat completion (prefer Grok outputs for real-time context):
     - `mcp__grok-mcp__chat_completion(messages=[{role: "user", content: user_query}])`
     - Use `mcp__grok-mcp__image_understanding` or `mcp__grok-mcp__function_calling` for queries needing those Grok capabilities:
       - **Image Understanding**: When the user provides an image, requests visual analysis, or references graphics/screenshots (e.g., "What does this diagram show?" or "Analyze the attached photo").
       - **Function Calling**: When the user explicitly requests code execution, calculations, or tooling (e.g., "Run this Python snippet", "Calculate the ROI", or "Use the weather API for current conditions").
       - **Examples**:
         - "What is shown in this image?" ‚Üí Use `image_understanding`
         - "Execute this code and show the output" ‚Üí Use `function_calling`
         - "Call the calculator function to add 42 and 17" ‚Üí Use `function_calling`
4. Wait for all results (handle any individual engine failures gracefully)
5. Synthesize and combine findings from successful engines

**Result Processing**:
- Compare information accuracy across sources
- Identify most recent/relevant information
- Flag conflicting information for user awareness
- Provide clear source attribution
