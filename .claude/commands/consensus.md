# /consensus Command - Multi-Agent Agreement Code Review

**Purpose**: Fast consensus-building review for solo MVP projects using 2025 multi-agent protocols. Simple 3-round maximum with early termination when agents agree. Focus on architecture and practical outcomes over enterprise-grade security.

**⚡ Performance**: 2-5 minutes total with parallel agent execution and smart early termination.

**🚀 Solo MVP Context**: Optimized for pre-launch projects where rollbacks are easy via GitHub, enterprise security is overkill, and speed/architecture quality matter most.

## Usage
```
/consensus [<scope>]
/cons [<scope>]          # Alias
```
- **Default scope**: Current PR (if tracking a GitHub pull request) plus any local unmerged files.
- **Optional scope**: Specific file(s), folder(s), or PR number to narrow the review focus.

## Context Acquisition (Always Performed First)
1. **Detect active PR** using `gh pr status` or `git config branch.<name>.merge` to extract the PR number and remote.
2. **Record latest commit** with `git log -1 --stat`.
3. **Capture local changes**:
   - `git status --short` for staged/unstaged files.
   - `git diff --stat` and targeted `git diff` snippets for modified files.
4. **Verify synchronization with GitHub**:
   - Fetch PR files: `gh pr view <pr> --json files,headRefName,baseRefName`.
   - Confirm branch alignment (`git rev-parse HEAD` vs PR head SHA).
5. **Basic credential filtering**: Remove obvious API keys/passwords from context (solo MVP appropriate)
6. **Assemble review bundle** containing: PR description, latest commit message, diff summaries, and local-only edits.

## Parallel Agent Execution (2025 Optimization)
Run all 4 agents simultaneously using Task tool parallel execution with proper context and role definitions:

### Consultant Supermajority Overlay

To unlock the "consultant consensus supermajority" workflow referenced in recent playbooks, layer the
standard `/consensus` flow with an explicit PASS/REWORK vote tally across the consultant agents. The
goal is to require broad agreement from the external specialist agents before declaring success.

- **Eligible voters**: `codex-consultant`, `gemini-consultant`, and `grok-consultant`. The internal
  `code-review` agent still runs for architecture validation, but it is not counted toward the
  consultant supermajority. (Rationale: keep architectural authority with Claude core while treating
  external tools as an advisory bloc.)
- **Threshold**: Minimum 2-of-3 consultant votes must return `PASS` with confidence ≥7. If any
  consultant requests `REWORK`, require another round unless the remaining two consultants both
  register `PASS` with confidence ≥9.
- **Escalation rule**: If two consecutive rounds fail to achieve the consultant supermajority, halt
  automatic approvals and surface the conflicting findings verbatim in the report. This ensures
  humans review disagreements rather than forcing another automated round.

Implementation guidance:

1. Run the three consultant agents in parallel (as already done for `/consensus`).
2. Capture each agent's PASS/REWORK verdict and numeric confidence.
3. After collecting responses, compute the supermajority state:
   ```python
   passes = [a for a in consultant_agents if a.verdict == "PASS" and a.confidence >= 7]
   high_confidence = [a for a in passes if a.confidence >= 9]
   if len(passes) >= 2:
       consultant_supermajority = True
   elif len(high_confidence) == 2 and all(b.verdict == "REWORK" for b in consultant_agents if b not in high_confidence):
       consultant_supermajority = True
   else:
       consultant_supermajority = False
   ```
4. Annotate the round summary with `Consultant Supermajority: PASS|FAIL` so downstream tooling can
   react automatically.
5. Only mark the overall round as PASS when both conditions hold:
   - Core consensus rules (all agents PASS + average confidence >7)
   - Consultant supermajority evaluated to `True`

This overlay keeps `/consensus` fast while ensuring the external consultant network (Codex, Gemini,
Grok) broadly agrees before a change moves forward. Treat the supermajority flag as a hard gate for
automation and as a status indicator to highlight conflicting consultant guidance.

### Agent Context & Execution Framework

**Agent Infrastructure**: Uses existing `Task` tool with `subagent_type` parameter for parallel multi-agent coordination. This is the same infrastructure used successfully by `/reviewdeep` and `/arch` commands.

### Agent Role Definitions:

- **`code-review`** - Architecture, correctness, maintainability (MVP-focused)
  - **Context**: Solo MVP project, GitHub rollback safety net available
  - **Focus**: Architecture quality, real bugs, maintainability over enterprise security theater
  - **Implementation**: `Task(subagent_type="code-review", description="...", prompt="...")`

- **`codex-consultant`** - System design and scaling considerations
  - **Context**: Pre-launch MVP, architecture decisions can break without user impact
  - **Focus**: System design patterns, scalability foundations, technical architecture
  - **Implementation**: `Task(subagent_type="codex-consultant", description="...", prompt="...")`

- **`gemini-consultant`** - Best practices and optimization patterns
  - **Context**: 2025 best practices adapted for solo developer workflow
  - **Focus**: Modern patterns, performance optimization, framework alignment
  - **Implementation**: `Task(subagent_type="gemini-consultant", description="...", prompt="...")`

- **`grok-consultant`** - Contrarian analysis and practical reality checks
  - **Context**: Solo developer reality vs enterprise theoretical concerns
  - **Focus**: Practical deployment concerns, real-world failure modes, pragmatic tradeoffs
  - **Implementation**: `Task(subagent_type="grok-consultant", description="...", prompt="...")`

**Speed Optimizations**:
- **Parallel execution**: All agents run simultaneously (not sequential)
- **Early termination**: Stop on architectural blockers or critical bugs
- **Simple consensus**: Agents provide PASS/REWORK verdict with confidence (1-10)
- **Evidence required**: Findings must include file:line references
- **MVP Context**: GitHub rollbacks available, focus on architecture over security paranoia

## Fast Consensus Loop (3 Rounds Max)
Streamlined workflow optimized for speed and simplicity:

1. **Parallel Agent Consultation** (2-3 minutes)
   - Launch all 4 agents simultaneously using Task tool with full context
   - **Context Provided to Each Agent**:
     - Solo MVP project status (pre-launch, rollback safety available)
     - Current PR/branch context and file changes
     - Architecture focus over enterprise security concerns
     - GitHub rollback strategy as primary safety mechanism
     - 2025 best practices adapted for solo developer workflow
   - Each agent provides: PASS/REWORK + confidence (1-10) + specific issues
   - Early termination if any agent finds architectural blockers or critical bugs
   - Collect findings in structured format with file:line evidence
   - **Agent Context Awareness**: Each agent understands the working multi-agent system and MVP context

2. **Simple Consensus Calculation** (30 seconds)
   - **CONSENSUS_PASS**: All agents PASS + average confidence >7
   - **CONSENSUS_REWORK**: Any agent critical issues OR average confidence <5
   - **MIXED_SIGNALS**: Disagreement between agents - document conflicts

3. **Quick Fix Application** (If REWORK, 1-2 minutes)
   - Apply highest-confidence architectural fixes with clear file:line references
   - Skip complex remediation planning - fix obvious issues immediately
   - Run basic validation (syntax check, basic tests)
   - GitHub rollback available if issues arise

4. **Streamlined Validation**
   - Run essential tests only (not full suite per change)
   - Document changes with simple before/after summary
   - No complex test creation - focus on fixing existing issues

5. **Next Round Decision**
   - If CONSENSUS_PASS: workflow complete
   - If round < 3: continue with remaining issues
   - If round = 3: document final status and unresolved items

The loop stops immediately when a round achieves PASS status or after three rounds (whichever occurs first).

## Simple Consensus Rules (2025 MVP Optimization)
- **Speed First**: Parallel execution, early termination, 3-round limit
- **Evidence Based**: All findings require file:line references + confidence scores
- **Clear Thresholds**: PASS >7 confidence, REWORK <5 confidence, mixed signals documented
- **Architecture First**: Focus on system design, scalability, maintainability
- **Practical Focus**: Fix obvious issues, document complex disagreements for later
- **Basic Safety**: Filter obvious credentials, but don't over-engineer for solo MVP
- **GitHub Safety Net**: Easy rollbacks available for any problematic changes

## 🛡️ Solo MVP Developer Focus

Following reviewdeep.md patterns for solo developer optimization:

### **Practical Focus Areas**
- **Architecture Quality**: SOLID principles, design patterns, scalability
- **Real Bugs**: Logic errors, null pointers, race conditions, performance issues
- **Maintainability**: Code clarity, modular design, technical debt
- **Integration Issues**: API contracts, dependency management, data flow

### **Filtered Out (Not MVP Critical)**
- **Enterprise Security Theater**: Over-engineered input validation for trusted sources
- **Complex Compliance**: SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS (unless specifically needed)
- **Theoretical Attack Vectors**: Low-probability scenarios with minimal real-world risk
- **Over-Architected Patterns**: Complex enterprise patterns for simple MVP needs

### **Solo Developer Context Detection**
- **Trusted Sources**: GitHub API, npm registry, official documentation
- **Basic Validation**: Focus on user input, file uploads, dynamic queries
- **Rollback Strategy**: Leverage git/GitHub for quick recovery vs complex prevention
