# /auto Command

Run the following workflow in order, making sure to complete each command fully without skipping any steps:

1. `/cons` – Carefully review the code for bugs and correctness issues, including logic errors, edge cases, off-by-one errors, and violations of expected behavior. Focus only on correctness, not style or performance. For more details on the `/cons` command and examples of issues to look for, see the [Cons Command Documentation](docs/cons-command.md).
2. `/pushl`
3. `/reviewdeep`
4. `/copilot`
5. `/guidelines`
