# Cereb - Cerebras Code Generation Alias

This is an alternative short alias for the `/cerebras` command.

## Task Execution

Claude: Check for `cerebras_direct.sh` in the trusted locations (look in `~/.claude/commands/cerebras` first, then in the repository `.claude/commands/cerebras`). Once you find it, run the script with the original arguments. If the script is missing from both locations, surface a clear error explaining the lookup failure.


## Post-Generation Analysis

I'll now review the Cerebras-generated output and provide:

1. **Code Quality Assessment** - Security, performance, best practices
2. **Integration Strategy** - How to merge with existing codebase  
3. **Testing Recommendations** - Unit tests, edge cases, validation
4. **Refinements** - Error handling, documentation, optimizations
5. **Next Steps** - Implementation plan, deployment considerations

The Cerebras output provides the foundation - I'll add the architectural thinking and integration expertise.
