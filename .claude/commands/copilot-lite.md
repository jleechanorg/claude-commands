## ⚡ EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE
**When this command is invoked, YOU (Claude) must execute these steps immediately:**
**This is NOT documentation - these are COMMANDS to execute right now.**
**Use TodoWrite to track progress through multi-phase workflows.**

## 🎯 MISSION

Atomic single-pass PR comment processor with ground truth verification.

**SCOPE**: ONLY fixes GitHub PR comments. Does NOT:
- ❌ Fix merge conflicts (use `/fixpr` separately)
- ❌ Fix failing tests (handle separately)
- ❌ Handle CI failures (not in scope)

**Key Principle**: Ground truth over inference - try the fix, report what actually happened.

**Architecture**:
- **Claude (LLM)**: Analyzes comments, attempts fixes, generates truthful responses
- **Python**: ONLY manages state and API calls (NO hardcoded responses)
- **Threading**: Proper GitHub threading via `in_reply_to` parameter

## 🚨 EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Environment Setup

**Action Steps:**
```bash
# Get PR context
BRANCH_NAME=$(git branch --show-current)
export BRANCH_NAME  # Export for Python subprocess
SAFE_BRANCH=$(python3 - <<'PY'
import os, re
branch = os.environ.get("BRANCH_NAME", "")
safe = re.sub(r"[^a-zA-Z0-9._-]", "_", branch)
safe = re.sub(r"^[.-]+", "", safe)
print(safe or "unknown-branch")
PY
)
WORK_DIR="/tmp/$SAFE_BRANCH"
mkdir -p "$WORK_DIR"

# Detect PR number
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number -q '.number' 2>/dev/null || echo "")
if [ -z "$PR_NUMBER" ]; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: No PR found for current branch"
    exit 1
fi

REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q '.nameWithOwner')
echo "🎯 Processing PR #$PR_NUMBER on $REPO (branch: $BRANCH_NAME)"
```

### Phase 2: Fetch ALL Comments

**Action Steps:**
Execute `/commentfetch` OR run directly:
```bash
# Fetch all comments from all sources (human + bot)
# Set pipefail so pipeline fails if commentfetch.py fails (not just tee)
set -o pipefail
python3 .claude/commands/_copilot_modules/commentfetch.py "$PR_NUMBER" 2>/dev/null | tee "$WORK_DIR/comments.json" >/dev/null || {
    # Fallback: fetch and combine comments manually, adding .type field to match commentfetch.py output
    gh api "repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/comments" --paginate | jq '[.[] | . + {type: "inline"}]' > "$WORK_DIR/inline_comments.json"
    gh api "repos/$REPO/issues/$PR_NUMBER/comments" --paginate | jq '[.[] | . + {type: "issue"}]' > "$WORK_DIR/issue_comments.json"
    # Combine into single comments.json file with {comments: [...]} structure to match commentfetch.py output
    jq -s '{comments: (.[0] + .[1])}' "$WORK_DIR/inline_comments.json" "$WORK_DIR/issue_comments.json" > "$WORK_DIR/comments.json"
}

# Verify comments.json was created (either by commentfetch.py or fallback)
if [ ! -f "$WORK_DIR/comments.json" ]; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: Comments fetch failed. $WORK_DIR/comments.json not created." && exit 1
fi

echo "📥 Comments fetched to $WORK_DIR/comments.json"
```

**Important**: This fetches ALL comments including:
- Human reviewer comments
- Bot comments (Codex, GitHub bots, etc.)
- Inline review comments
- General PR conversation comments

### Phase 3: Atomic Comment Processing (CORE - LLM RESPONSIBILITY)

**🚨 CRITICAL: Claude (LLM) MUST process each top-level comment atomically:**

For EACH **top-level (non-reply)** comment in `/tmp/{branch}/comments.json` (including bot comments):

1. **READ** the comment body and understand what is being requested
   - **Bot comments** requesting code changes should be treated like human comments
   - **Bot status updates** (e.g., "CI passed", "Merge conflict detected") should be SKIPPED

2. **CATEGORIZE** the comment request:
   - `CRITICAL`: Security vulnerabilities, production blockers, data corruption in PR code
   - `IMPORTANT`: Performance issues, logic errors, missing validation in PR code
   - `ROUTINE`: Code style, documentation, optional refactoring suggestions
   - **SKIP**: Bot status updates, merge conflicts, test failures, or CI issues (not in scope)
     - Examples to SKIP: "Merge conflict detected", "Tests failed", "CI check pending"
     - Examples to PROCESS: "@codex please fix this bug", "Bot: This function has a security issue"
   - **Replies**: If a comment has `in_reply_to_id` (i.e., it is a reply), SKIP generating a response entry for it in `responses.json`; only top-level comments require responses for coverage accounting

3. **ATTEMPT** the fix (if applicable):
   - Read the affected file(s)
   - Make the code change using Edit/MultiEdit tools
   - Verify syntax is correct
   - Commit the change with descriptive message
   - **NOTE**: Do NOT fix tests or merge conflicts - only address the specific comment request
     - If the comment is about merge conflicts, failing tests, or CI status, categorize it as **SKIP** in Step 2 and respond with a `SKIPPED` entry (no ATTEMPT changes)

4. **GENERATE** a truthful response based on ACTUAL outcome:

**Response Types**:
- **FIXED**: Successfully implemented the change
  - MUST include: commit hash, files modified, verification status
- **NOT DONE**: Could not implement (with REAL reason from actual attempt)
  - MUST include: specific error or constraint that prevented implementation
- **ACKNOWLEDGED**: Style suggestion noted for future consideration
- **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED**: Code already does this (MUST show evidence)
  - MUST include: file path, line number, code snippet proving implementation
- **SKIPPED**: Comment is about merge conflicts, test failures, CI issues, or bot status updates (out of scope)
  - MUST include: brief note directing to appropriate command (/fixpr for merge conflicts)
  - Examples: Bot status updates like "Merge conflict detected", "CI pending"
  - **NOTE**: Bot comments requesting actual code changes should NOT be skipped - treat them like human comments

### Phase 4: Build responses.json

**🚨 Claude MUST write responses to `/tmp/{branch}/responses.json`:**

```json
{
  "response_protocol": "ACTION_ACCOUNTABILITY",
  "responses": [
    {
      "comment_id": "2357534669",

      "in_reply_to": null
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Phase 4.5: MANDATORY VERIFICATION GATE (HARD REQUIREMENT)

**🚨 CRITICAL: You CANNOT proceed to Phase 5 until this gate passes.**

**Action Steps:**
```bash
# Working directory + PR metadata (exported in Phase 1)
# Reuse BRANCH_NAME, SAFE_BRANCH, WORK_DIR, REPO, PR_NUMBER from Phase 1 (do NOT recalculate)

# Validate prerequisites
if [ ! -f "$WORK_DIR/comments.json" ]; then
    echo "🛑 ERROR: $WORK_DIR/comments.json not found."
    echo "➡️  Please complete Phases 1-2 before running this step."
    exit 1
fi

# Count all top-level inline review comments (comments on code, not replies)
# Note: commentfetch.py outputs {comments: [...]} with .type field ("inline", "general", "review", "copilot")
TOTAL_INLINE=$(jq '[ (.comments // .)[] | select((.type == "inline") and ((.in_reply_to_id // null) == null)) ] | length' "$WORK_DIR/comments.json")

# Count ALL top-level non-inline comments (PR conversation, reviews, copilot), excluding replies
TOTAL_ISSUE=$(jq '[ (.comments // .)[] | select((.type != "inline") and ((.in_reply_to_id // null) == null)) ] | length' "$WORK_DIR/comments.json")

TOTAL=$((TOTAL_INLINE + TOTAL_ISSUE))
if ! [[ "$TOTAL" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: Unable to compute TOTAL from $WORK_DIR/comments.json" && exit 1
fi
echo "📊 Total top-level comments requiring response: $TOTAL"

# Count comments addressed in responses.json
if [ ! -f "$WORK_DIR/responses.json" ]; then
    echo "🛑 ERROR: $WORK_DIR/responses.json not found."
    echo "➡️  Please complete Phase 4 before running this step."
    exit 1
fi

ADDRESSED=$(jq '.responses | length' "$WORK_DIR/responses.json")
if ! [[ "$ADDRESSED" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: Unable to compute ADDRESSED from $WORK_DIR/responses.json" && exit 1
fi
echo "📋 Comments addressed in responses.json (including SKIPPED entries): $ADDRESSED"

# HARD GATE: Assert 100% coverage
if [ "$ADDRESSED" -ne "$TOTAL" ]; then
    echo "❌ VERIFICATION FAILED: $ADDRESSED / $TOTAL comments addressed"
    echo "⚠️ MISSING: $((TOTAL - ADDRESSED)) comments without responses"
    echo ""
    echo "🔍 Identifying missing comment IDs..."
    # List all comment IDs from fetched comments (top-level only)
    jq -r '(.comments // .)[] | select(((.in_reply_to_id // null) == null)) | .id | tostring' "$WORK_DIR/comments.json" > "$WORK_DIR/all_comment_ids.txt"
    # List addressed comment IDs (normalize to strings)
    jq -r '.responses[].comment_id | tostring' "$WORK_DIR/responses.json" > "$WORK_DIR/addressed_ids.txt"
    # Find missing
    echo "📌 Missing comment IDs (must address before proceeding):"
    comm -23 <(sort -n "$WORK_DIR/all_comment_ids.txt") <(sort -n "$WORK_DIR/addressed_ids.txt")
    echo ""
    echo "🛑 STOP: Return to Phase 3 and address missing comments"
    # DO NOT PROCEED - loop back to Phase 3
    exit 1
fi

# SUCCESS: Gate passed
echo "✅ VERIFICATION PASSED: $ADDRESSED / $TOTAL (100% coverage)"
echo "➡️ Proceeding to Phase 5..."
rm -f "$WORK_DIR/all_comment_ids.txt" "$WORK_DIR/addressed_ids.txt" 2>/dev/null || true
```

**Gate Rules:**
1. **TOTAL** = All top-level comments (inline + issue) that are NOT replies (SKIPPED comments still count toward this total)
2. **ADDRESSED** = Number of entries in responses.json (including SKIPPED entries)
3. **PASS** = ADDRESSED == TOTAL
4. **FAIL** = Any mismatch → identify missing IDs → return to Phase 3

**If Gate Fails:**
- List all missing comment IDs
- Return to Phase 3 and process each missing comment
- Re-run Phase 4.5 verification
- Repeat until 100% coverage achieved

### Phase 5: Post Responses with Threading

**Action Steps:**
```bash
# Get repo info
OWNER=$(gh repo view --json owner -q '.owner.login')
REPO_NAME=$(gh repo view --json name -q '.name')
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number -q '.number')

# Post all responses with proper threading
python3 .claude/commands/commentreply.py "$OWNER" "$REPO_NAME" "$PR_NUMBER"
```

**Threading Contract**:
- `in_reply_to` field enables GitHub's native threading
- Review comments (inline): Uses `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull}/comments` with `in_reply_to`
- Issue comments (general): Uses `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{pull}/comments` with reference link

### Phase 6: Verification

**Action Steps:**
Execute `/commentcheck` to verify 100% comment coverage:
```bash
/commentcheck
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Every comment has a response in responses.json
- ✅ Every response was successfully posted to GitHub
- ✅ All FIXED responses have valid commit hashes
- ✅ All NOT_DONE responses have real failure reasons

### Phase 7: Push & Summary

**Action Steps:**
```bash
# Push all committed fixes
git push origin HEAD

# Generate summary
echo "📊 COPILOT-LITE SUMMARY:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
jq -r '.responses | group_by(.response) | .[] | "\(.[0].response): \(length)"' "$WORK_DIR/responses.json"
```

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES

### Rule 1: Ground Truth Verification
```python
# ❌ WRONG (inference without verification)
if comment.suggests("sanitize branch name"):
    response = "ALREADY IMPLEMENTED - .strip() handles this"
    # ^ FALSE! .strip() removes whitespace, NOT path separators

# ✅ RIGHT (actual code verification)
code = read_file("src/utils.py")
if ".replace('/', '_')" in code:
    response = f"ALREADY IMPLEMENTED - See src/utils.py:{line_number}"
    # Show actual code snippet as proof
else:
    # Not implemented - attempt to fix it
    result = attempt_fix(comment)
```

### Rule 2: Try Before Claiming NOT_DONE
```python
# ❌ WRONG (assumption without attempt)
return "NOT DONE: This would require significant refactoring"
# ^ Made up reason without trying

# ✅ RIGHT (real attempt with real outcome)
try:
    apply_fix()
    run_tests()
    commit()
    return f"FIXED: {commit_hash}"
except Exception as e:
    return f"NOT DONE: {str(e)}"
# ^ Actual reason from actual attempt
```

### Rule 3: No False Implementation Claims
```python
# ❌ WRONG (confusing similar operations)
# Comment: "Sanitize branch name for file system"
# Code has: result.stdout.strip()
response = "ALREADY IMPLEMENTED - branch is sanitized"
# ^ .strip() removes whitespace, NOT slashes!

# ✅ RIGHT (verify exact behavior)
# Look for: .replace('/', '_') or similar
# Only claim implemented if actual sanitization exists
```

### Rule 4: Every Comment Gets Response (Human + Bot)
- **FIXED**: Change was made and verified
- **NOT_DONE**: Attempted but failed (include real reason)
- **ACKNOWLEDGED**: Style suggestion, noted
- **ALREADY_IMPLEMENTED**: Code already does this (with evidence)
- **SKIPPED**: Bot status updates, merge conflicts, test failures, or CI (out of scope)

**Bot Comment Handling:**
- Bot comments requesting code changes → Process like human comments (FIXED/NOT_DONE/etc.)
- Bot status updates (CI, merge conflicts) → SKIPPED

**NO COMMENT LEFT BEHIND** - 100% response rate is mandatory (human + bot).

## 📊 Response Categories

| Response | When to Use | Required Fields |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| `FIXED` | Successfully implemented change (human or bot comment) | `action_taken`, `files_modified`, `commit`, `verification` |
| `NOT_DONE` | Attempted but couldn't implement (human or bot comment) | `reason` (from actual failure) |
| `ACKNOWLEDGED` | Style/non-blocking suggestion (human or bot comment) | `explanation` |
| `ALREADY_IMPLEMENTED` | Code already has this feature (human or bot comment) | `evidence` (file, line, code snippet) |
| `SKIPPED` | Bot status updates, merge conflicts, tests, or CI | `reason` (brief explanation + command to use) |

## 🔧 Integration with Existing Commands

This command composes with:
- `/commentfetch` - Fetches all PR comments
- `/commentreply` - Posts responses with proper threading
- `/commentcheck` - Verifies 100% coverage
- `/pushl` - For pushing changes

**NOT included** (handle separately):
- `/fixpr` - Use separately for merge conflict resolution
- Test fixing - Handle via separate test commands
- CI troubleshooting - Handle via separate debugging

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Accuracy Requirements (MANDATORY)
- [ ] No miscategorizations (ACKNOWLEDGED when should be FIXED)
- [ ] No false implementation claims
- [ ] Every "ALREADY IMPLEMENTED" includes code evidence
- [ ] Every "FIXED" includes commit hash and verification
- [ ] Every "NOT DONE" includes real failure reason from actual attempt
- [ ] Every "SKIPPED" correctly identifies out-of-scope comments (merge conflicts, tests, CI)

### Coverage Requirements (MANDATORY)
- [ ] 100% comment response rate (human + bot comments)
- [ ] All responses posted with proper threading
- [ ] No comments skipped without explicit reason

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] All FIXED changes pass tests
- [ ] All commit messages reference the comment being addressed
- [ ] Response text clearly explains what was done or why not

## 📝 Usage

```bash
# Run the command
/copilot-lite

# Or use alias
/copilotl
```

**What happens:**
1. Fetches ALL PR comments (human + bot)
2. For EACH comment: attempts fix → verifies → generates truthful response
3. Posts ALL responses with proper threading
4. Verifies 100% coverage
5. Pushes all committed fixes

**What this does NOT handle:**
- ❌ Merge conflicts (use `/fixpr`)
- ❌ Test failures (handle separately)
- ❌ CI issues (debug separately)

**Key Difference from /copilot:**
- `/copilot`: Multi-phase (Phase 0-3), can lose state between phases
- `/copilot-lite`: Single-pass atomic, each comment fully processed before moving to next
- `/copilot-lite`: ONLY fixes code comments, not merge conflicts or tests

## 🚨 Autonomous Operation

This command operates autonomously without user approval prompts for:
- ✅ Code analysis and fixes
- ✅ Response generation
- ✅ Comment posting
- ✅ Push operations

**EXCEPTION**: Merge operations ALWAYS require explicit user approval ("MERGE APPROVED").
