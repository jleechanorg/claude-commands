# Ralph Orchestration Command

**Purpose**: Launch Ralph task agent to autonomously execute complex multi-step goals with continuous iteration until completion.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Ralph vs Genesis

**Ralph** = Standalone ralph-orchestrator fork at `/Users/$USER/projects_other/ralph-orchestrator`
- Uses Codex CLI by default (200K context via OpenRouter)
- Separate codebase from WorldArchitect.ai
- Command: `python -m ralph_orchestrator`

**Genesis** = WorldArchitect.ai orchestration system (different from Ralph!)
- Located at: `/Users/$USER/projects/worktree_ralph/genesis/`
- **Uses Codex CLI by default** (can override with `--claude` flag)
- Command: `python genesis/genesis.py`
- See `/gene` command for Genesis execution

## Ralph Repository Location

**Required**: `/Users/$USER/projects_other/ralph-orchestrator`

This command will verify the Ralph repo exists before executing. If you want to use a different Ralph installation, specify the repo path as the first argument.

## Usage

```bash
/ralph <goal-file-path> [max-iterations] [ralph-repo-path]
```

**Parameters**:
- `goal-file-path`: Path to markdown goal file defining the autonomous task
- `max-iterations`: (Optional) Maximum iterations before stopping (default: 20)
- `ralph-repo-path`: (Optional) Path to Ralph repo (default: `/Users/$USER/projects_other/ralph-orchestrator`)

## How Ralph Works

Ralph is an autonomous task agent that:
1. **Uses Codex CLI by default** - larger context windows (200K tokens) via OpenRouter
2. **Reads goal files** in markdown format with clear success criteria
3. **Creates task-specific agents** in tmux sessions for parallel work
4. **Iterates continuously** until goal completion or max iterations reached
5. **Self-corrects errors** by analyzing failures and adjusting approach
6. **Commits progress** regularly to track incremental changes
7. **Reports completion** with evidence of success criteria met

**Default Agent**: `--agent codex` (can override with `--agent claude`, `--agent gemini`, or `--agent auto`)
**Fallback Mode**: Use `--agent auto` to try Codex ‚Üí Claude ‚Üí Gemini automatically

## Goal File Format

Ralph goal files must follow this structure:

```markdown
# Goal: [Clear one-sentence goal statement]

## Current Status
[Document starting state]

## Tasks
1. **Task Name**: Clear, actionable task description
2. **Task Name**: Next sequential task

## Success Criteria
‚úÖ Criterion 1 (measurable outcome)
‚úÖ Criterion 2 (verification method)
‚úÖ Criterion 3 (deliverable exists)

## Autonomous Execution
Ralph should:
1. Read this goal file
2. Execute all tasks sequentially
3. Test after each step
4. Document results
5. Commit and push when complete
```

## Best Practices for Ralph Goals

### ‚úÖ DO: Write Autonomous-Ready Goals
- **Clear success criteria**: Ralph must know when it's done
- **Measurable outcomes**: "Tests pass" not "Code works"
- **Specific paths**: Provide exact file locations and repo paths
- **Sequential tasks**: Order matters - dependencies first
- **Test validation**: Include test commands Ralph can run
- **Commit protocol**: Specify when to commit (after each file, after task, etc.)

### ‚ùå DON'T: Create Vague Goals
- "Make it better" - No measurable outcome
- "Fix bugs" - Which bugs? Where?
- "Improve performance" - By how much?
- "Update documentation" - Which files? What content?

## Example: Production Deployment Goal

```markdown
# Goal: Complete Production MCP Server Deployment

## Current Status
‚úÖ Mock server working (15/15 tests passing)
‚ùå Production server crashes (Firebase initialization error)

## Tasks

### Task 1: Fix Firebase Authentication
**Location**: `/path/to/project/src/config/firebase.ts`

**Issue**: Server crashes with "Service account object must contain 'private_key'"

**Fix**: Implement Application Default Credentials (ADC) support
```typescript
// Add ADC fallback path
else if (process.env.FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID) {
  console.log('üîë Using Application Default Credentials (ADC)');
  firebaseApp = initializeApp({ projectId: process.env.FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID });
}
```

**Validation**:
```bash
cd /path/to/project
npm run build
npm start
curl http://localhost:3001/health  # Should return 200 OK
```

### Task 2: Test Production Functionality
After server starts successfully:

1. **Test campaign creation**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/campaigns \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id":"test","title":"Test Campaign","setting":"fantasy"}'
```

2. **Test interaction** (use campaign_id from step 1):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/campaigns/{id}/interaction \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id":"test","user_input":"I explore the dungeon"}'
```

3. **Verify in Firebase Console**: Campaign and interaction documents exist

### Task 3: Document Production Deployment

Create `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md` with:
- Prerequisites (Node.js, Firebase, credentials)
- Environment variables required
- Deployment steps
- Validation tests
- Known issues

### Task 4: Commit and Push

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: add production deployment support with ADC authentication

- Implement Application Default Credentials fallback
- Add production deployment documentation
- Validate with real Firebase/Gemini credentials

Tested with campaign creation and interaction endpoints."
git push origin HEAD:production-deployment-work
```

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Production server starts without errors (health endpoint responds)
‚úÖ Campaign creation works with real Firebase (document exists in Firestore)
‚úÖ Interaction endpoint works with real Gemini (response generated)
‚úÖ PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md exists with complete deployment guide
‚úÖ All changes committed and pushed to remote branch
‚úÖ Final validation report created with test results

## Autonomous Execution

Ralph should:
1. Read this goal file
2. Execute all 4 tasks sequentially
3. Test after each fix
4. Document results in validation report
5. Commit and push when complete
6. Report final status with evidence
```

## Ralph Orchestration Workflow

When you execute `/ralph`:

1. **Verify Ralph Repository**
   ```bash
   # Default location
   RALPH_REPO="/Users/$USER/projects_other/ralph-orchestrator"

   # Or use custom location from parameter
   if [ $# -ge 3 ]; then
       RALPH_REPO="$3"
   fi

   # Verify repo exists
   if [ ! -d "$RALPH_REPO" ]; then
       echo "‚ùå ERROR: Ralph repository not found at: $RALPH_REPO"
       echo "Please ensure ralph-orchestrator is cloned to the expected location"
       echo "Or specify custom path: /ralph <goal-file> <iterations> <ralph-repo-path>"
       exit 1
   fi

   echo "‚úÖ Found Ralph repository at: $RALPH_REPO"
   ```

2. **Goal File Validation**
   - Verify goal file exists and is readable
   - Check for required sections (Goal, Tasks, Success Criteria)
   - Confirm autonomous execution instructions present

3. **Launch Ralph Orchestrator**
   ```bash
   cd "$RALPH_REPO"

   # Activate virtual environment if it exists
   if [ -d ".venv" ]; then
       source .venv/bin/activate
   fi

   # Run Ralph with Codex agent (explicit default)
   python -m ralph_orchestrator "$GOAL_FILE" \
       --agent codex \
       --max-iterations "$MAX_ITERATIONS" \
       --verbose
   ```

4. **Monitor Ralph Progress**
   - Ralph creates tmux sessions for work
   - Agent logs to Ralph's log directory
   - Check Ralph output for progress updates

5. **Verify Completion**
   - Check Ralph's completion report
   - Verify all success criteria met
   - Review git commits for evidence of work

## Common Ralph Patterns

### Security-Sensitive Tasks
Ralph may refuse tasks that appear to violate security policies (credential harvesting, malicious code). If this happens:

1. **Clarify intent**: Update goal file to explain credentials already exist
2. **Change framing**: "TEST the server" not "FIND credentials"
3. **Provide context**: Explain this is legitimate development work

### Production vs Mock Mode
For testing with real services:

1. **Document credential location**: Tell Ralph where `.env` file is
2. **Specify test validation**: How Ralph verifies real service integration
3. **Expected errors**: Document known limitations (e.g., Firestore indexes)

### Commit Protocol
To avoid infinite loops, always specify commit frequency:

```markdown
## üö® MANDATORY COMMIT PROTOCOL

After creating or modifying ANY file, immediately commit:
```bash
git add <filename>
git commit -m "feat: add <filename>"
```

**Progress Validation (every 5 files)**:
1. Run: `git log --oneline | head -10`
2. Verify: `git status` shows clean
3. If untracked files exist, commit them before proceeding
```

## Troubleshooting

### Ralph Gets Stuck in Analysis Paralysis
**Symptom**: Ralph runs for hours but generates minimal code

**Solutions**:
1. Kill Ralph process: `pkill -f "orchestrate_unified.py.*<goal-file-name>"`
2. Review goal file - may be too vague or lack measurable success criteria
3. Add explicit commit protocol to force progress tracking
4. Reduce max iterations to force completion

### Ralph Refuses Security-Sensitive Tasks
**Symptom**: Ralph stops with "violates security policy" message

**Solutions**:
1. Update goal file to clarify legitimate intent
2. Change task framing from "search for" to "use existing"
3. Document that credentials/resources already exist
4. Provide exact file paths to eliminate search behavior

### Ralph Claims Success Without Changes
**Symptom**: Ralph reports task complete but `git status` shows no changes

**Solutions**:
1. Add verification checklist to goal file:
   - File existence check
   - Git diff validation
   - Commit verification
   - Work evidence (file paths + line numbers)
2. Require Ralph to provide specific evidence of changes
3. Mandate git commit after each task

## Integration with Other Commands

- **`/orch`**: Launch generic orchestration (use Ralph for autonomous task execution)
- **`/converge`**: Similar autonomous execution with different iteration strategy
- **`/cons`**: Review Ralph's code quality after completion
- **`/checkpoint`**: Save Ralph's progress before major changes

## Real-World Ralph Usage Example

From TypeScript migration benchmark (commit 09ab17d):

```bash
# Ralph command (uses Codex by default)
/ralph /Users/$USER/projects/orch_worldai_ralph/complete-production-deployment.md 30

# Explicit execution (what Ralph does internally)
cd /Users/$USER/projects_other/ralph-orchestrator
python -m ralph_orchestrator \
    /Users/$USER/projects/orch_worldai_ralph/complete-production-deployment.md \
    --agent codex \
    --max-iterations 30 \
    --verbose
```

**Goal**: Fix undefined field bug, document Firestore index requirement, validate production functionality

**Ralph's Autonomous Execution**:
1. ‚úÖ Applied conditional spread operator fix (line 39 CampaignService.ts)
2. ‚úÖ Created PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md with deployment guide
3. ‚úÖ Rebuilt server (`npm run build`)
4. ‚úÖ Tested campaign creation (campaign ID: vG64GU7JppVOdFJP2QqL)
5. ‚úÖ Tested interaction endpoint (documented expected index error)
6. ‚úÖ Committed changes (commit 09ab17d)
7. ‚úÖ Pushed to remote branch (task-agent-fix-goal-failin-work)

**Evidence**: All success criteria met, working production server, complete documentation

## When to Use Ralph vs Genesis

**Use Ralph (`/ralph`)** for:
- Tasks requiring **large context windows** (200K tokens via Codex)
- Autonomous execution with Codex's stronger reasoning
- Complex multi-file refactoring
- When you want fallback to Claude ‚Üí Gemini automatically
- Standalone projects outside WorldArchitect.ai

**Use Genesis (`/gene`)** for:
- Tasks within WorldArchitect.ai project context
- When you want fast-gen mode with Cerebras speed
- Integrated with WorldArchitect.ai's codebase and tools
- Also uses Codex by default (same model as Ralph)
- When you need WorldArchitect.ai-specific context

## When to Use Ralph vs Manual Work

**Use Ralph** for:
- Multi-step tasks with clear success criteria (5+ steps)
- Production deployments requiring validation
- Bug fixes with specific test cases
- Autonomous execution while you work on other tasks
- Benchmark comparisons

**Manual work** for:
- Exploratory coding without clear endpoint
- Architectural decisions requiring human judgment
- Creative feature design
- Complex debugging requiring hypothesis testing
- Tasks requiring frequent user input
