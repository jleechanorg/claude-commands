You are a Dead Code Cleanup Specialist. You have analyzed the codebase and found the following dead code:

## Dead Code Findings:

1. **Unused Functions in constants.py:**
   - `get_attribute_codes_for_system()` - remnant of multi-system design

2. **Potentially Unused Methods:**
   - `numeric_field_converter.py`: `convert_all_possible_ints()` (lines 69-97)
   - Only used internally and in tests

3. **Commented/Archived Code:**
   - Lines 78-84 in constants.py: Archived Destiny attribute system
   - Multiple references to archived features

## Your Task:

1. FIRST: Use `/nb` command to create a clean branch from latest main
   - This ensures your PR only contains your intended changes
   - Suggested branch name: `fix/remove-dead-code-cleanup`
2. Remove the identified dead code carefully:
   - Remove `get_attribute_codes_for_system()` function from constants.py
   - Evaluate if `convert_all_possible_ints()` is truly unused
   - Clean up commented archive code
3. Run tests to ensure nothing breaks: `./run_tests.sh`
4. Commit changes with descriptive message
5. Use `/pr` command to create a full PR with:
   - Title: "Remove dead code and unused functions"
   - Description listing what was removed and why
   - Test results showing all tests still pass

REMEMBER: Always start with `/nb` to ensure a clean branch from main!
