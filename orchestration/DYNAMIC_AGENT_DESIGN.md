# Dynamic Agent Orchestration Design

## Overview

This document describes the transformation of the orchestration system from static, predefined agent types to a pure dynamic agent system where agents are created on-demand based on natural language task descriptions.

## Architecture Transformation

### Before: Static Agent System
```
├── frontend-agent (predefined)
├── backend-agent (predefined)
├── testing-agent (predefined)
└── opus-master (coordinator)
```

### After: Dynamic Agent System
```
├── opus-master (coordinator - optional)
└── task-agent-* (created dynamically per task)
```

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Single Entry Point
- **Command**: `python3 orchestration/orchestrate_unified.py "task description"`
- **No predefined agent types** - agents understand tasks naturally
- **Dynamic naming**: `task-agent-{timestamp}` for uniqueness

### 2. Task-Based Agent Creation
```python
# User provides natural language task
"Fix all failing tests in the authentication module"

# System creates appropriate agent
task-agent-1234:
  - Understands task context
  - Has full development capabilities
  - Works in isolated environment
  - Self-terminates after PR creation
```

### 3. Isolated Work Environment
- Each agent gets fresh git worktree from main
- No cross-contamination between tasks
- Clean PR creation per task

### 4. Self-Contained Workflow
Each agent:
1. Starts with task description
2. Works in isolated tmux session
3. Commits to fresh branch
4. Creates PR automatically
5. Terminates cleanly

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **orchestrate_unified.py**
   - Single entry point for all agent creation
   - Handles task parsing and agent spawning
   - Manages worktree creation

2. **task_dispatcher.py**
   - Dynamic agent capability discovery
   - Load balancing across agents
   - No hardcoded agent mappings

3. **start_system.sh**
   - Minimal setup (directories, Redis optional)
   - No static agent startup
   - Only starts opus-master if requested

### Agent Lifecycle

```
User Task → orchestrate_unified.py → Create Worktree → Spawn Agent → Execute Task → Create PR → Terminate
```

## Benefits

1. **Simplicity**: One command creates any agent needed
2. **Flexibility**: Agents adapt to task requirements
3. **Isolation**: Each task gets clean environment
4. **Scalability**: No artificial agent type limits
5. **Maintainability**: No static configuration to update

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Any development task
python3 orchestration/orchestrate_unified.py "Add user authentication to the API"

# Testing tasks
python3 orchestration/orchestrate_unified.py "Write integration tests for payment system"

# Bug fixes
python3 orchestration/orchestrate_unified.py "Fix memory leak in image processing"

# Infrastructure
python3 orchestration/orchestrate_unified.py "Set up CI/CD pipeline for staging"
```

## Status Coordination

Currently uses file-based coordination:
- `/tmp/orchestration_results/` for agent results
- `tasks/shared_status.txt` for status updates

Future enhancement: Optional Redis layer for real-time updates while maintaining file-based fallback.

## Migration from Static System

This PR completes the transformation by:
1. Removing all hardcoded agent type references
2. Eliminating static task files
3. Converting monitoring to support dynamic agents
4. Updating documentation to reflect new architecture

The system now operates as a pure dynamic agent orchestration platform.
